Viewers can add comments on videos and they can also forward “hearts” to streamers as a token of appreciation for their impressive work. The app is actually very interaction with four major tabs:</p><p> 1. You will find two lists on <strong>first tab:</strong></p><p> First one is the Teleport option that takes broadcaster to any random place in world and reflects that place as your active broadcast location.</p><p> The second list contains information about all those broadcasts that you have viewed within last 24 hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-1.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-1 "                ></p><p> 2. <strong>The second tab</strong> on application is used to display list of public broadcasts on global level and users are free to join all of them. They are developed on the basis of your geographical location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-2.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-2 "                ></p><p> 3. <strong>The third tab</strong> again contains the information about list of live public broadcasts in list format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-3.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-3 "                ></p><p> 4. <strong>The fourth tab</strong> is designed to assist users with easy search for followers. It also displays settings for your own profile and allows users to make basic adjustments for followers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-4.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-4 "                ></p><h2 id="How-to-watch-Periscope-Video"><a href="#How-to-watch-Periscope-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to watch Periscope Video?"></a>How to watch Periscope Video?</h2><p> If you want to enjoy a live broadcast on Periscope then you can either try the list format or go for the map version on global broadcast tab; simply touch over the ongoing event that seems interesting to you. It also allows real time interactions with the broadcasters as well as other users that are connected during a particular live event.</p><p><strong>The lists of features include:</strong></p><p> 1. You will find a say something field on your application at bottom portion; whenever you want to comment for any event, you can put your text in this field.</p><p> 2. On the right side, you will observe hearts and they keep on floating upward. Whenever you find something very interesting or just want to appreciate the efforts of broadcaster on channel then you can use these hearts as token for your words of appreciation. You need to tap on the screen to send this heart to broadcaster.</p><p> 3. There is a little person on bottom right corner of your app screen; it provides information about number of viewers on your broadcast. If you touch this tiny icon, it will take you to another page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-5.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-5 "                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Broadcast-on-Periscope"><a href="#How-to-Broadcast-on-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="How to Broadcast on Periscope?"></a>How to Broadcast on Periscope?</h2><p> As per the default setting, broadcasts stay public that means anyone can watch what you have uploaded. But in case if you want to prioritize your audience then Periscope application offers easy personalization. Use private broadcast feature to invite selected audience on your broadcasts. This broadcast setting icon is actually a small camera like shape that can be used from first as well as second tab easily.</p><p> During your very first visit to broadcast screen, you will find a permission required pop up. Here you have to hit on allow permissions option. Now enable all three options that appear on screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-6.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-6 "                ></p><p> Now you are at broadcast screen where you have to enter name or title of your broadcast event. Users can adjust their location preferences while converting broadcasts from private to public or vice versa view. Adjust the chat options and finally you will reach at your Twitter link. If you want to capture feeds from webcam then it can be switched easily by simply double tapping on device screen. Once all these controls have been adjusted then your app provides an event summery, you can approve it or edit before making your post live. It will also provide you details about how many hearts you have received from viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-7.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-7 "                ></p><p> Once your broadcast becomes live then it will stay online for next 24 hours and all viewers and followers will be able to replay, watch as well as share the information with other users. The collection of hearts as viewer’s response may go on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-8.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-8 "                ></p><h2 id="Tips-to-get-more-followers-or-viewers-on-Periscope"><a href="#Tips-to-get-more-followers-or-viewers-on-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="Tips to get more followers or viewers on Periscope"></a>Tips to get more followers or viewers on Periscope</h2><p> There is no doubt to say that Periscope is a wonderful tool if you want to make your career as a live streaming and want to grow size of your followers fast. Below are few important tips to gain more followers&#x2F;viewers on Periscope:</p><p> 1. Once you have gained lots of knowledge and expertise in a particular area then it is good to develop few scopes so that you can easily share your hints and tips related to that topic. The #hash tag feature helps to attract more audience towards your posts.</p><p> 2. The most essential task that you need to focus upon during your upload is to add eye catching titles for your content.

The rule is to follow relevant content marketing boosted titles phrases.</p><p> 3. Make some efforts to encourage viewers to send more hearts for your broadcasts. More hearts means you will achieve higher rank on periscope. If you share your scope then viewers can go through it for next 24 hours.</p><p> 4. The powerful solution to grow size of your audience is to stay active to collaborate with other Periscope users. This tip can add more value to your business when you start working in collaboration with other experts.</p><p> 5. Never forget to turn on that Twitter sign while posting your content on scope.</p><p> 6. Update your location details time to time.</p><p> 7.

How to live stream with Online OneStream"></a>Part 3. How to live stream with Online OneStream</h2><p>Live streaming with OneStream is pretty straightforward. I will walk you through a series of steps you can follow to live stream using OneStream successfully.</p><p>Step1 First, head to <a class="link"   href="https://app.onestream.live/signup" >OneStream live website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create an account. Just input a username, password, and email address. After that, you need to choose a plan. OneStream offers 4 plans, as I have mentioned above. Just go through the plan features and choose the one that best suits you.</p><p>Step2 After you have successfully picked a plan, on the dashboard, you will see 40 top social platforms, and you will be requested to add your social accounts. If you can’t see the social platform you want to live stream to, you can use custom RTMP to stream it. Except for Instagram, you can connect all of your social accounts directly.</p><p>To connect your Instagram account, you must utilize a third-party software called Instafeed. Instead, it will construct your Instagram account’s Sync URL. Once the URL is generated, please copy and paste it into the OneStream Sync URL section. It will successfully connect your Instagram account to OneStream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-1.jpg"                      alt="connect onstream to your social accounts"                ></p><p>Step3 To schedule your live stream on the dashboard, click the “three-line” button.

If information is not delivered in a way that piques the listener’s attention and creates a picture in their mind, the human brain will typically lose interest. The podcast intro lasts for only about sixty seconds.</p><p>They say,</p><p>“The first impression is the last impression.”</p><p>So, how can you utilize these sixty seconds to hook the audience to your podcast? It is through crafting a dramatic intro with a script that it is bound to leave an impression on the listener.</p><p>If you’re new to podcasting or having difficulties attracting an audience, keep reading to get some scoop on how to compose an opening that will sweep the listener off his feet.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-podcasts-intros"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-podcasts-intros" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What are podcasts intros?"></a>Part 1. What are podcasts intros?</h2><p>A podcast intro is like a teaser that gives an insight into what the episode will be about. The introduction to the podcast usually appears at the start of the podcast.</p><p>Its duration varies from thirty to sixty seconds but acts as the determinant of the show’s success. A good podcast intro is like a warrior that aids in scoring the audience, competing with thousands of other openings.</p><p>A well-designed intro usually starts with a hook grabbing the listener’s undivided attention. So the listener would have no choice but to press the play button to find out more. So now, let’s see some key elements of a podcast intro.</p><ul><li><strong>The podcast’s name</strong> is critical to give the listener a sense of what they will be listening to.</li><li><strong>The episode title</strong> is a one-word summation of the entire episode’s content.</li><li><strong>Host introduction</strong>, introduce yourself and the co-hosts to the listener to develop familiarity.</li><li><strong>Background music</strong> draws the listener in and should be relevant to the introduction.</li><li><strong>The tagline</strong> is a major element that retains the listener’s interest.</li><li><strong>Sponsors</strong>, if you have any, put their names in the introduction.</li><li><strong>Disclaimer</strong>, if your podcast contains any spoilers, it should be mentioned in the disclaimer.</li></ul><p>Now that you know what a podcast intro is? Let’s discuss why it matters!</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-does-the-intro-to-podcasts-matter"><a href="#Part-2-Why-does-the-intro-to-podcasts-matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why does the intro to podcasts matter?"></a>Part 2. Why does the intro to podcasts matter?</h2><p>Podcasts have gained massive popularity over the last decade. Currently, over 30 million podcasts are available, making it even harder for you to gain an audience if you are starting a new podcast.</p><p>The game is to entice the listener so that he would want more, and for that, we need an intro that is powerful enough to intrigue the audience. After establishing why we need a podcast intro, let’s look at some sample intros from popular podcasts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-do-podcast-intros-in-trending-podcasts-sound-like"><a href="#Part-3-What-do-podcast-intros-in-trending-podcasts-sound-like" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

This podcast has around 2.2 million listeners. Ira Glass hosts the show, and episodes are released weekly. Ira introduces a new character in each episode and inquires about their background.</p><h3 id="My-favorite-murder"><a href="#My-favorite-murder" class="headerlink" title="My favorite murder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.exactlyrightmedia.com/myfavoritemurder" >My favorite murder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcasts-intros-2.jpg"                      alt="my favorite murder"                ></p><p>My favorite murder is the fifth most popular podcast according to the US charts. Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark host this show and discuss the true crime stories narrated by their friends or family. It has also been nominated for the best podcast award and has about 30 million listeners.</p><h3 id="Stuff-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Stuff-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Stuff You Should Know"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-stuff-you-should-know-26940277/" >Stuff You Should Know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcasts-intros-3.jpg"                      alt="stuff you should know"                ></p><p>“Stuff You Should Know” is the sixth most popular podcast, and it is hosted by Josh Clark and Charles W, who usually talk about current customs and traditions. This podcast is very informative and addresses concerns that people face daily. Now let’s analyze the intros of the podcasts as mentioned above.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Elements&#x2F;Podcasts</th><th><em>This American Life</em></th><th><em>My favorite murder</em></th><th><em>Stuff you should know</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sound effects</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Length of the intro</td><td>60 seconds</td><td>50 seconds</td><td>40 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Podcast name</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Intro of guests</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>Disclaimer</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>Genre (of the podcast)</td><td>Storytelling</td><td>Crime show</td><td>Informative</td></tr><tr><td>Podcast intro CTA</td><td>If you haven’t tried the previous episodes, you should, as the story will get deeper and more complicated.</td><td>It is the one where you can email us stories about your childhood pranks or any other incident, and you, too, can be a part of this show.</td><td>We all listen to the stuff you should know podcast to get to the bottom of the biggest mysteries of pop culture.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Table 1: shows the analysis of intros of the top 3 podcasts discussed above</em></p><p>Now that we’ve established which elements are more prominent in the intros of some of the most popular podcasts. Let’s review the essentials you should keep in mind when designing your introduction.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-a-good-podcast-intro"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-a-good-podcast-intro" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How to make a good podcast intro?"></a>Part 4. How to make a good podcast intro?</h2><p>If you want the audience to be unable to resist your podcast, design your podcast intro with the following tips in mind.</p><h3 id="How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be"><a href="#How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be" class="headerlink" title="How long should a podcast intro be?"></a>How long should a podcast intro be?</h3><p>Your podcast intro should be brief and snappy. The ideal duration for a podcast intro is between 30 to 60 seconds. However, it should not last more than a minute and a half.</p><p>The intro of “This American Life” lasted for sixty seconds, while the intro of stuff you should know was over in about forty seconds. Both of these intros were short and to the point. However, they did an excellent job of providing just the correct information to pique the audience’s interest.</p><h3 id="Is-background-music-helpful-in-making-the-intro-more-appealing"><a href="#Is-background-music-helpful-in-making-the-intro-more-appealing" class="headerlink" title="Is background music helpful in making the intro more appealing?"></a>Is background music helpful in making the intro more appealing?</h3><p>Selecting a soundtrack or sound effects for your podcast intro is optional, but it enhances the quality of the content presented. The soundtrack should be chosen carefully as it functions as a logo that presents a brand.</p><p>A soundtrack can also give a classy feel to your intro and aid the listeners in vibing to your content. For instance, if you intend to present horror content in your podcast, spooky background music and sound effects can help the listener get into the mood. To avoid copyright issues, you can find free music at the YouTube audio library or Pixabay.</p><h3 id="Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why"><a href="#Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why" class="headerlink" title="Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?"></a>Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?</h3><p>Including a call to action at the start or the end of your intro can serve as a good marketing strategy for your social media account. Call-to-action phrases such as, “if you like our podcast, be sure to leave us a review,” can also serve as a hook to capturing the listener’s attention.</p><p>In the call to action, you can ask your listeners to do any of the following.</p><ul><li>Recommend your podcast to their friend circle.</li><li>Visit your social media page and leave a review.</li><li>To listen to the previous episodes.</li><li>To buy your work, whether it’s a book or a magazine.</li></ul><p>A call to action is also effective in establishing familiarity with the listener. There is no right or wrong CTA, and you can select any given phrases that suit your podcast.</p><ul><li>If you enjoy our podcasts, don’t forget to subscribe.</li><li>Share our content with your friends and family; it’ll help us create more content.</li><li>If you like any changes in the format, do leave your suggestions in the comment box.</li></ul><p>For instance, in the intro of “This American Life,” Ira Glass uses the phrase, “If you haven’t tried the previous episodes yet, you should.” reminding the new audience to check the previous episodes as well.</p><h3 id="When-is-the-right-time-to-introduce-yourself-and-your-guests"><a href="#When-is-the-right-time-to-introduce-yourself-and-your-guests" class="headerlink" title="When is the right time to introduce yourself and your guests?"></a>When is the right time to introduce yourself and your guests?</h3><p>Logically it would help if you introduced yourself to the new audience right after introducing the name of your podcast. Introducing yourself is not challenging, but you can use guest introductions to create a buzz that will help you gain your listeners’ attention.</p><p>The proper way to introduce your episode guest is to tell your audience about their background, how you know them, and why you invited them to your podcast. It will pique the listener’s interest, and they will tune in to learn more. Now that you recognize what elements to pay attention to if you want to create a killer podcast intro.</p><p>Let’s look at the samples of some of the most popular podcast intros.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-podcast-introduction-examples"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-podcast-introduction-examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Let’s review the essentials you should keep in mind when designing your introduction.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-a-good-podcast-intro-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-a-good-podcast-intro-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How to make a good podcast intro?"></a>Part 4. How to make a good podcast intro?</h2><p>If you want the audience to be unable to resist your podcast, design your podcast intro with the following tips in mind.</p><h3 id="How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be-1"><a href="#How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be-1" class="headerlink" title="How long should a podcast intro be?"></a>How long should a podcast intro be?</h3><p>Your podcast intro should be brief and snappy. The ideal duration for a podcast intro is between 30 to 60 seconds. However, it should not last more than a minute and a half.</p><p>The intro of “This American Life” lasted for sixty seconds, while the intro of stuff you should know was over in about forty seconds. Both of these intros were short and to the point. However, they did an excellent job of providing just the correct information to pique the audience’s interest.</p><h3 id="Is-background-music-helpful-in-making-the-intro-more-appealing-1"><a href="#Is-background-music-helpful-in-making-the-intro-more-appealing-1" class="headerlink" title="Is background music helpful in making the intro more appealing?"></a>Is background music helpful in making the intro more appealing?</h3><p>Selecting a soundtrack or sound effects for your podcast intro is optional, but it enhances the quality of the content presented. The soundtrack should be chosen carefully as it functions as a logo that presents a brand.</p><p>A soundtrack can also give a classy feel to your intro and aid the listeners in vibing to your content. For instance, if you intend to present horror content in your podcast, spooky background music and sound effects can help the listener get into the mood. To avoid copyright issues, you can find free music at the YouTube audio library or Pixabay.</p><h3 id="Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why-1"><a href="#Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why-1" class="headerlink" title="Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?"></a>Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?</h3><p>Including a call to action at the start or the end of your intro can serve as a good marketing strategy for your social media account. Call-to-action phrases such as, “if you like our podcast, be sure to leave us a review,” can also serve as a hook to capturing the listener’s attention.</p><p>In the call to action, you can ask your listeners to do any of the following.</p><ul><li>Recommend your podcast to their friend circle.</li><li>Visit your social media page and leave a review.</li><li>To listen to the previous episodes.</li><li>To buy your work, whether it’s a book or a magazine.</li></ul><p>A call to action is also effective in establishing familiarity with the listener. There is no right or wrong CTA, and you can select any given phrases that suit your podcast.</p><ul><li>If you enjoy our podcasts, don’t forget to subscribe.</li><li>Share our content with your friends and family; it’ll help us create more content.</li><li>If you like any changes in the format, do leave your suggestions in the comment box.</li></ul><p>For instance, in the intro of “This American Life,” Ira Glass uses the phrase, “If you haven’t tried the previous episodes yet, you should.” reminding the new audience to check the previous episodes as well.</p><h3 id="When-is-the-right-time-to-introduce-yourself-and-your-guests-1"><a href="#When-is-the-right-time-to-introduce-yourself-and-your-guests-1" class="headerlink" title="When is the right time to introduce yourself and your guests?"></a>When is the right time to introduce yourself and your guests?</h3><p>Logically it would help if you introduced yourself to the new audience right after introducing the name of your podcast. Introducing yourself is not challenging, but you can use guest introductions to create a buzz that will help you gain your listeners’ attention.</p><p>The proper way to introduce your episode guest is to tell your audience about their background, how you know them, and why you invited them to your podcast. It will pique the listener’s interest, and they will tune in to learn more. Now that you recognize what elements to pay attention to if you want to create a killer podcast intro.</p><p>Let’s look at the samples of some of the most popular podcast intros.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-podcast-introduction-examples-1"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-podcast-introduction-examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Adding all those special effects, sound effects, background music, text, lower third green screen and more. And what you can see in the image below is the default add-on I always attach to all of my videos on YouTube, my default social media watermark on the upper-right corner of it. And usually, it’s static and I added it until the end of a video, just to remind the viewers all of my social media platforms.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you want to be a YouTuber&#x2F;vlogger like us, choose a name that really represents your personal being and make it as simple as it can be, easily to memorize and just one name for all of your social media platforms. In that case, your viewers can easily search your name throughout those said online rostrums.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-name-for-haul-video.jpg"                      alt="choose name for haul video"                ></p><p>The image below shows how I started to market the shirt that I bought from Adidas. What kind of fabric it has, is it suitable for the weather in the Philippines because I want to send it way back home and what particular size it is?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/market-shirt-video.jpg"                      alt="market shirt video"                ></p><p>I add a pop-up image and that image was the name of the online seller wherein I bought the t-shirt. And for your information, here in Israel; online selling is very common most specially within the Filipino community.</p><p>Next is I added a text to emphasize the price of the t-shirt and as you can see, I just chose the simplest title I got. There are lots of Titles to choose from as you can see in the image below. Choose what you think suits best for your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-text-to-haul-video.jpg"                      alt="add text to haul video"                ></p><p>What I love about haul video, is that I know what to add throughout the video itself because it’s the same process actually. I need to describe the item first, then add a pop-up image of the seller or even place where I bought the item, and its price. Everything you need to know basically. So, in the image below; I insert the name of the Facebook Page where I bought that Tribal inspired shirt. When it comes to street wear, there’s no better brand than <strong><em>Tribal Philippines</em></strong>. It is a brand supported by many great artists, especially in music, if you want to know it’s origin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/insert-brand-name-haul-video_.jpg"                      alt="insert brand name haul video"                ></p><p>Another thing that you can see on my haul video is that I love to showcase my co-YouTuber so that viewers on my channel can check his&#x2F;her channel too.</p><p>I’ll add my outro afterwards and that’s the end of it.

But the thing is, it’s your intention that really matters. And I think the key to a successful haul video is that, things that are of good quality but less amount of money.

Though it may be a low-grade virtual reality, the thing is, it’s still VR. Google has a platform wherein you can open your android phone into a cut-rate VR viewer called <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Google Cardboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The focus of this app is mostly put on games and experiences but it also empowers VR videos which are lightly immersed.</p><p>When your android phone has a VR viewer, you can have your own freedom of watching and looking around the world for 360-degree videos. Whether you’re watching an animated trippy clip, savoring a concert footage, watching stunts from all sides and angles; with VR viewer, it would feel like you’re actually among the crowd or in the place as the ones you’re watching. VR viewers like Google Cardboard makes the experience of watching videos less passive and creates new ways of visual storytelling.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">1.Choosing between VR and 360 Videos</a></li><li><a href="#part2">2.Steps to Watch 360 Videos on Android</a></li><li><a href="#part3">3.Watching Local Videos on Android</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/google-cardbaorad-1.jpg"                      alt="google-cardbaorad-1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Choosing-between-VR-and-360-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Choosing-between-VR-and-360-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Choosing between VR and 360 Videos"></a>Part 1. Choosing between VR and 360 Videos</h2><p>The first distinction between VR and 360 Videos is that 360 videos can be watched and viewed with Cardboard and other VR handsets but 360 videos aren’t just like VR videos because VR videos with the right content has the depth of illusion.</p><p><strong>VR videos</strong> are stereoscopic 3D (has a different right and left eye point of view) which means these VR videos are providing added immersion by giving the sense of being on place in the world you’re watching such as nearby close-up objects while further items seem to off and far away. This only sounds like a very subtle difference between a 360 video and a VR video but in addition, the 3D quality is better used on VR handsets and can be justified by just placing your android phone up your eyes.</p><p>However, <strong>360 videos</strong> act mostly in the same manner. With the use of a phone’s gyroscope, it will let you look around as you take footage and they can still be viewed via VR viewer in good quality. Most cases show that non-VR video contents seem to be actually sharper when viewed on Cardboard. That’s why sometimes, depth is swapped with clarity whenever you choose between VR and 360 videos.</p><p>The higher frame rate and resolution of 360 videos and VR videos result to more pleasurable video experience especially via Cardboard. Videos with lower frame rate can actually add blurry artifacts which can then cause you to be a bit nauseous while watching the video. Nasty blurs can affect the focus of your eye that’s why you may feel nauseous. Opt for VR and 360 videos that have options of maximum quality when streaming. It’s okay if it needs more bandwidth.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Revolutionize-Your-Online-Presence-with-These-Eight-Strategies"><a href="#Revolutionize-Your-Online-Presence-with-These-Eight-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="Revolutionize Your Online Presence with These Eight Strategies"></a>Revolutionize Your Online Presence with These Eight Strategies</h2><p>The past few years have taught business owners a valuable lesson. It has never been easier to start an online business and succeed.</p><p>There are plenty of ways to do this. But Reddit marketing is proving to be among the most promising ones. Reddit is a platform where communities of over 1.5 billion users in total gather every month.</p><p>Using the right Reddit marketing strategy can result in more sales, clients, and traffic. This guide will be your crash course on how to do Reddit marketing. Expect tons of actionable tips that will help you succeed faster.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?"></a>Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?</h2><p>Reddit is a place for gathering. It’s where communities of all interests can connect and share ideas, knowledge, experiences, and more.</p><p>The rules of Reddit are simple.</p><p><strong>Upvotes &amp; Downvotes</strong></p><p>First, there are Upvotes and Downvotes. This determines which posts go on top and which ones get buried down below. The more Upvotes a post has, the more it will be seen. The more Downvotes it has, the more irrelevant it becomes.</p><p><strong>SubReddits</strong></p><p>Subreddits are communities within Reddit. Each subreddit is dedicated to a topic. For example, there are subreddits about food, gaming, and finance…… you name it!</p><p>Each subreddit has its members. Some have hundreds of thousands of members, while other subreddits only have a couple of hundred or fewer.</p><p>The idea behind them is to make Reddit a more organized place where you can easily find what you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Content and Posting</strong></p><p>The most important part of Reddit is the posts. What you post can have a significant impact on whether you reach a vast audience or not.</p><p>Ideally, posting valuable advice that will genuinely help someone out works best. However, you can also post entertaining content, personal experiences, and more.</p><p>You’ll be fine if it doesn’t go against Reddit’s guidelines.</p><p><strong>Reddit Karma</strong></p><p>Last but not least, Reddit Karma is another crucial feature. It is a status symbol. It reflects how much you contribute to each Reddit community. The more Karma you have, the more authority and value your actions on Reddit have.</p><p>You can earn more Reddit karma by receiving Upvotes on your posts and comments.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should You Do Reddit Marketing?"></a>Part 2. Why Should You Do Reddit Marketing?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reddit-marketing-logo.png"                      alt="reddit marketing"                ></p><p>The main reason you should learn how to market on Reddit is because of its vast number of daily and monthly users. Let’s look at some facts.</p><ul><li>Reddit currently gets <strong>1.7 billion</strong>monthly users</li><li>It is ranked <strong>#19</strong>out of all the other sites on the internet globally</li><li>It is also ranked <strong>#12</strong>among all the websites in the United States</li></ul><p>All this means is that you have billions of potential customers to reach on Reddit each month. As a result, it may be the perfect platform for you to market your business and achieve amazing results.</p><p>There are even more good news and reasons to attempt a Reddit marketing strategy for your business.</p><p>Reddit has a somewhat unique audience. Close to <strong>50%</strong> of Reddit users don’t use Instagram. A higher percentage than this don’t use TikTok as well. Additionally, <strong>90%</strong> of Reddit users go there to learn about new products and brands.</p><p>That is an excellent opportunity to use Reddit marketing for your business. It’s literally where people go to learn more about your business.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Market on Reddit - 5 Actionable Ways"></a>Part 3. How to Market on Reddit - 5 Actionable Ways</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-market-on-reddit.png"                      alt="marketing on reddit"                ></p><p><strong>Create Unique Content and Provide Value for Your Audience</strong></p><p>Content is king when it comes to Reddit. To get good results, your content MUST help the reader in some way. Find out what your audience’s problems are and pour your heart and soul into finding a solution for them.</p><p>It will be worth it in the long run.</p><p><strong>Be Consistent and Persistent</strong></p><p>Doing one Reddit post, no matter how good it may be, will rarely do the trick. The key to creating any type of content is consistency and value.</p><p>There are three major reasons why this is crucial:</p><p>- It builds trust among your audience. This makes it easier to sell to them later</p><p>- Adds a lot to your credibility. The more you increase your credibility, the easier it is to sell to new viewers</p><p>- It gets more eyes on you. The more content you post, the more potential customers you acquire</p><p><strong>Listen to Feedback and Host AMAs</strong></p><p>AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything”. This offers a perfect opportunity for you to connect with your audience. It lets you find out more about them. This is crucial information that will help you increase your sales and make more money in the long run.</p><p>Feedback is very important for a growing business. It’s a simple way to research your audience. Remember, the more you know about their fears, issues, attractions, and similar… the more you can improve your brand and meet their demands.</p><p>Reddit has its own<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/" >AMA subreddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It currently has over 22 million members. Here, you can post who you are and what you do. Then, expect plenty of questions from your audience.</p><p><strong>Always Support Your Audience</strong></p><p>Making money is great. But, always promoting your business and talking about yourself will never bring good results. The key is to put your audience in front.</p><p>You need to care about your customers. Talk to them, offer free advice, listen to their needs, and engage more with them. The more you put their interests ahead of your own, the better the impact on your business.</p><p>For example, when a user asked “<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fel08/what%5Fcompany%5Fhas%5Fsuch%5Fgood%5Fcustomer%5Fservice%5Fthat/" >What company has such good customer service that every other company should aspire to? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“, the comments were overflooded with the word “Amazon”.</p><p><strong>Advertise on Reddit</strong></p><p>There are two types of Reddit ads you need to be doing:</p><ul><li>Takeover Ads</li><li>Promoted Ads</li></ul><p>To be successful with your Reddit marketing strategy, you must know how to run ads.</p><p>The first step is to go over as many<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddiquette.com/reddit-ad-examples/" >examples of successful Reddit marketing campaigns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as you can.</p><p>Second, you must familiarize yourself with<a class="link"   href="https://redditinc.force.com/helpcenter/s/article/Reddit-Advertising-Policy-Overview" >Reddit’s advertising policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Make sure you’re not creating an ad that goes against their rules.</p><p>Lastly, have a clear objective. Know why you’re creating your ad. Is it to increase your audience? Is it to get more sales? Is there another reason?</p><p>Knowing all of this will significantly improve your results and also give you insights on what type of Reddit ad to create. And now, you know how to market on Reddit. So, go out there and make this happen.</p><h2 id="Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit"><a href="#Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The holodeck was what true Virtual Reality should be, full body tactile immersion both narrative immersion, which occurs “when the viewer becomes emotionally invested in the story” and the feeling of “really being there”, called spatial immersion.</p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Differences between VR, AR and MR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Virtual Reality Technology: Current State and Future Challenges <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><h2 id="The-equipment-used-for-VR-is-very-expensive"><a href="#The-equipment-used-for-VR-is-very-expensive" class="headerlink" title="The equipment used for VR is very expensive"></a>The equipment used for VR is very expensive</h2><p> Of course with any early stage technology, there are a host of issues to overcome among the first is cost for consumers to participate. Many systems run between $100 and $600 and we have not yet discussed the cost of purchasing experiences or games.</p><h2 id="Low-resoultion-content-large-file-size"><a href="#Low-resoultion-content-large-file-size" class="headerlink" title="Low resoultion content, large file size"></a>Low resoultion content, large file size</h2><p> The new goggles or headsets that are coming out offer best available high resolution displays. But gaming experience is coming on at low resolution, leaving you with a low resolution experience. Below is a greatly condensed technical discussion explaining why VR is still so profoundly mediocre.</p><ul><li><strong>File size</strong></li></ul><p> Current VR platforms require a some kind of download to begin. Often the file sizes are over 1 GB and requisitely, slow.</p><ul><li><strong>Video quality</strong></li></ul><p> The next issue is simply video quality. Most VR is in stereo format and the hardware is just not able to fully support it. The video comes through grainy and muffled like it was shot that way and of course it was not. Improved resolution is the fix. There is another obvious thought here. Why claim to have a market worthy product when one of the fundamental technologies, viewing, is still unstable?</p><ul><li><strong>Resolution</strong></li></ul><p> What is the issue with fixing resolution. A couple of questions must be addressed to solve the problems. What is the display resolution? This is the screen resolution. The second question is, “Does all of the images that can come through, actually come through or is it cut off in some way?” This is field-of-view resolution. These questions have technical answers and industry engineers are working to provide a seamless solution, but we are brought back to the conclusion that VR technology while close to delivering true Phase I, which is reasonably easy to use technology is not quite there. Industry insiders use language like it is still in its experimental stage, of course that will not stop the industry from selling these units to early adopters.</p><ul><li><strong>Social Consequences</strong></li></ul><p> There is an addictive quality of Virtual Reality environments that should not be ignored. Those who are regular users of these spaces, even in its developmental state find that it can be hard to stay away. Users find themselves in some cases, preferring the virtual world to the real one. If these anecdotal experiences are being reported by a very small sample size what will be the impact on entire cultures that embrace this technology? Considerations of Virtual Reality must extend into the world of human activity and definitions of normal behavior. And as a reminder most of us who love science fiction have a sense of what true Virtual Reality really is. It should be clear that we are a very long way from enjoying the holodeck.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Best-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editor: Wondershare Filmora"></a>Best Video Editor: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-shadow-play-with-iphone-pro-photography-tips/"><u>2024 Approved  Shadow Play with iPhone  Pro Photography Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-achieving-expert-colors-for-images/"><u>[Updated] Step-by-Step  Achieving Expert Colors for Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-from-viral-tiktok-to-custom-phone-ringtones/"><u>2024 Approved  Step-by-Step  From Viral TikTok to Custom Phone Ringtones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/personalized-gift-boxes-unlocked-the-best-online-shopping-spots-for-2024/"><u>Personalized Gift Boxes Unlocked  The Best Online Shopping Spots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-inside-the-core-of-vitas-video-editing-a-full-guide-and-critical-review-2024/"><u>[New] Inside the Core of Vita's Video Editing - A Full Guide & Critical Review, 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-launching-at-optimal-times-a-podcast-guide/"><u>[New] Launching at Optimal Times  A Podcast Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/must-visit-web-resources-for-text-aesthetics-and-functionality-for-2024/"><u>Must-Visit Web Resources for Text Aesthetics & Functionality for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/premium-pfr-rate-for-easy-going-footage-for-2024/"><u>Premium PFR Rate for Easy-Going Footage for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/updated-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation-for-2024/"><u>Updated Simple Guide to Create New and Exciting Blackboard Animation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-top-30-mobile-video-edits-using-dji-technology/"><u>[Updated] Top 30 Mobile Video Edits Using DJi Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/unveiling-8-premium-linux-tools-for-efficient-snaps/"><u>Unveiling 8 Premium Linux Tools for Efficient Snaps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/mastering-images-10-instagram-enhancing-apps/"><u>Mastering Images  10 Instagram Enhancing Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/updated-ever-changing-era-of-ai-video-translation-a-reality-to-be-fulfilled/"><u>Updated Ever-Changing Era of AI Video Translation A Reality to Be Fulfilled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-to-use-ispoofer-on-realme-12plus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to use iSpoofer on Realme 12+ 5G?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Leveraging-LUT-Technology-in-Adobe-Premiere"><a href="#Leveraging-LUT-Technology-in-Adobe-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="Leveraging LUT Technology in Adobe Premiere"></a>Leveraging LUT Technology in Adobe Premiere</h2><p>Whether you’re working on a personal project or a business campaign, the procedure is very much the same:</p><p>you grab the camera, follow your idea, and acquire your pictures, then transfer the movie to your computer and start editing. In this protracted creative process, color grading is typically the final and possibly at least one of the most crucial processes. We all hoped there’s a way to speed up this procedure, and fortunately there is! Let’s start!</p><h2 id="1-How-to-install-LUTs-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#1-How-to-install-LUTs-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. How to install LUTs in Premiere Pro"></a>1. How to install LUTs in Premiere Pro</h2><p>LUTs can be applied in Premiere Pro in two different ways. Utilizing LUTs through the Creative tab of the Lumetri Color Panel is the simplest method. However, it does not make the LUTs a permanent part of the collection.</p><p>Step1Download your LUTs bundle, then unzip it to get the LUTs out. Find and copy the.Cube format files. They are the 3D LUTs file format.</p><p>Step2Locate the Lumetri LUTs folder in your Premiere Pro installation directory (for example, C: Program Files&#x2F;AdobePremiere Pro CC&#x2F;LumetriLUTSCreative).</p><p>Step3Paste all of your fresh LUTs in this folder at this time. Your new LUTs will now show up in the Lumetri Color Panel when you launch Premiere Pro (or restart the software if it was already open). Innovative &gt;&gt; Looks</p><h2 id="2-How-to-add-LUTs-to-your-footage"><a href="#2-How-to-add-LUTs-to-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="2. How to add LUTs to your footage"></a>2. How to add LUTs to your footage</h2><p>Step1Choose the Color Workspace at the top after your clip is in the timeline and prepared for grading.</p><p>Step2Click OK after selecting New Item &gt; Adjustment Layer in the Project window’s bottom left corner. The adjustment layer will show up in your project window in step three. It can then be dropped on the track above your video by clicking and dragging it onto the timeline. To make sure it covers the entire piece of film, click, and drag.</p><p>Step3The first Basic Correction option in the right-hand panel of Lumetri Color is Input LUT. Choose this, click Browse, and then go to the location where your LUTs are stored.</p><p>Step4Double-click the LUT you wish to use once you’ve located it, and it will be applied immediately.A tiny tip I like to use occasionally is to find the Effect Controls panel on the left side, then click the drop-down arrow next to Opacity, and make adjustments if you input your LUT and feel that it’s too intense.</p><h2 id="3-Why-use-LUTs-in-your-project"><a href="#3-Why-use-LUTs-in-your-project" class="headerlink" title="3. Why use LUTs in your project?"></a>3. Why use LUTs in your project?</h2><p>When there is no time limit or restriction on when to submit the result file, it is fun to edit your own clips because you have complete creative control over the process. Because of this, Color Grading is a rather unimportant aspect to worry about. After making a few adjustments to the Exposure and Contrast settings, you should be good to go.</p><p>Your finished product, when paired with the appropriate color scheme, has the power to create the atmosphere you want for the video, but managing that aspect of the project can be challenging at times.</p><p>Because of this, some designers employ look-up tables (LUTs) that they have created themselves or something that is currently available on the internet and is ready to install and use.</p><p>When it comes to working on a project for a customer that has a stringent deadline to fulfill, poor color grading could result in a negative impression of your work. This is the case even if everything from the sound effects to the video effects is done to a high standard and is done well.</p><h2 id="4-Can-you-adjust-the-strength-of-the-LUT"><a href="#4-Can-you-adjust-the-strength-of-the-LUT" class="headerlink" title="4. Can you adjust the strength of the LUT?"></a>4. Can you adjust the strength of the LUT?</h2><p>There are no such modifications that can be made in a certain LUT or Look, and there is no reason to adjust them because there is no need to. However, you may change its strength, which is essentially the same thing as the opacity of the LUT that was applied, and there are still choices to color grade the entire movie after the LUT has been applied.</p><p>The entire color panel in Premiere Pro is packed with all of the color grading tools that are required to adjust your film in the appropriate way. Investigating them can provide you with some understanding of how they function. You can get a sense of how these LUTs function by using the pre-installed LUTs that are accessible in Premiere Pro, which you can use at first to get a feel for the LUTs before moving on to using paid or free Color Grading profiles.</p><p>The end outcome does not vary by a substantial amount, but how it looks can change depending on the LUT you use. In the event that something seems to be lacking, you can always modify the color grading.</p><h2 id="5-Export-LUTs"><a href="#5-Export-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="5. Export LUTs"></a>5. Export LUTs</h2><p>An awesome feature of Premiere Pro enables you store and reuse your color modifications in multiple projects or programs. You have the option of exporting color grading information as either a.look file or a .cube LUT file, which may then be used in Adobe Premiere Pro or another application. Here’s how you export them:</p><p>Click on the pop-up menu labeled “Lumetri Color,” then select one of the following options:</p><p>Step1”.look” exports color adjustments as a Lumetri file. Exporting “.look” File containing a Look preset, saved in the.look format.</p><p>Step2Export “.cube” This function exports lookup tables in the.cube format so that they can be imported into other color grading programs.</p><p>Step3Store Preset: You can personalize the settings for each color effect, then save the resulting combinations as presets. Within the Save Preset dialog box, give your preset the name you want it to have. If desired, enter a description. Please visit the article on how to create and store an effect preset for further details.</p><h2 id="6-Where-can-you-find-LUTs"><a href="#6-Where-can-you-find-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="6. Where can you find LUTs?"></a>6. Where can you find LUTs?</h2><p>You might be asking, “Now that I’ve learned more about LUTs (Lookup Tables), where can I get even more LUTs?” since you’ve gained some new knowledge. In the end, being able to use the built-in LUTs in Luminar is a nice feature, but these are merely samples of the thousands upon thousands of LUTs that are accessible, both for free and for purchase.</p><ul><li>Osiris Cinematic LUTs</li><li>Finishing LUTs</li><li>DELUTS</li><li>Filmic Tone LUTs</li><li>Luminar</li><li>Complete Cinema LUTs</li><li>Filmic Tone LUTs</li><li>Urban Dark Creative LUTs</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Additionally, check to see if you have inadvertently downloaded any viruses. There is a strong temptation to simply conduct a search for cinematic LUTs on Google, then download all free files that we come across.</p><p>Sometimes, some of them are out there to steal your money rather than provide the color correcting settings that you desire. One other thing that could have been wrong is if your LUT files were placed in the incorrect folder. Please ensure that this is not the case by performing a second check.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-pioneering-physical-activity-bests-in-virtual-treadmills/"><u>[New] Pioneering Physical Activity  Bests in Virtual Treadmills</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/masterful-motion-graphics-for-texts-for-2024/"><u>Masterful Motion Graphics for Texts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/quickening-ppt-tempo-a-guide-to-faster-slides-for-2024/"><u>Quickening PPT Tempo  A Guide to Faster Slides for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-slimmed-down-cloud-keeping-at-low-cost-high-space/"><u>[New] Slimmed-Down Cloud Keeping at Low Cost, High Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-melody-match-maker-audio-ambience-for-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Melody Match-Maker  Audio Ambience For Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-sony-bdp-s3700-overhaul-a-new-perspective-review/"><u>In 2024, Sony BDP-S3700 Overhaul  A New Perspective Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/mastered-listings-top-8-free-uhd-video-players-cross-platform-for-windows-pcandmac-for-2024/"><u>Mastered Listings -

As we all know, many podcasters are doing all it takes to get their podcast to the right audience, but the truth is you don’t just publish a podcast any day. Although this might sound weird to newbies, professionals should know this.</p><p>You need to have a specific day(s) with time to release your podcast and stick to it. Doing so will allow you to build trust and loyalty amongst listeners.</p><p>With that said, knowing the best day to release a podcast is crucial for any podcaster, and in this article, we’ll enlighten you on all you need to know about that. So, just stick with us to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Does-Podcast-Publishing-Schedule-Matter"><a href="#Part-1-Does-Podcast-Publishing-Schedule-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Does Podcast Publishing Schedule Matter?"></a>Part 1: Does Podcast Publishing Schedule Matter?</h2><p>Having a podcast publishing schedule might sound negligible, but it is very essential for every podcaster, especially newbies. Listeners will stick to your podcast if they find it interesting, but to make them loyal, you need to build trust by publishing podcasts regularly on specific days and times every week. In addition, doing this will make your podcast more relevant in the space.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that choosing a suitable publishing schedule for your podcast depends on the niche you focus on and your target audience. So, when making such a decision, it’s crucial to opt for the days you can stay consistent with.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Best-Day-To-Release-a-Podcast-The-Megaphone-Report"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Best-Day-To-Release-a-Podcast-The-Megaphone-Report" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Is the Best Day To Release a Podcast? (The Megaphone Report)"></a>Part 2: What Is the Best Day To Release a Podcast? (The Megaphone Report)</h2><p>Truth be told, no specific day is considered the best to release a podcast. However, Megaphone’s report on the daily podcast publishes report shows that podcasters tend to publish their podcast more on weekdays (Monday - Friday) between 2 AM, 5 AM, and 11 PM. The chart below explains the stat report better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-day-to-release-a-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="best-day-to-release-a-podcast"                ></p><p>As you can see from the chart above, the best day to publish a podcast is on weekdays. But check the following chart to see the median number of total downloads for every podcast episode posted per hour during the weekdays.</p><p>The chart on the left is the number of episodes published per hour from Monday to Friday, while the chart on the left displays the median total downloads of episodes the podcast episodes get over time.</p><p>Overall, it shows that podcast episodes published in the early hours of a new day tend to do better until 5 AM when their performance starts to drop. However, episodes published just before noon does best in the afternoon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-day-to-release-a-podcast-2.jpg"                      alt="best-day-to-release-a-podcast"                ></p><h3 id="Takeaways-for-the-best-day-to-release-a-podcast"><a href="#Takeaways-for-the-best-day-to-release-a-podcast" class="headerlink" title="Takeaways for the best day to release a podcast"></a>Takeaways for the best day to release a podcast</h3><p>Here is our take on the podcast publish statistics analyzed by Megaphone in the charts above.</p><p><strong>1. Weekdays are much more popular than weekends</strong></p><p>From the podcast publish days’ statistics in the chart above, it’s obvious most podcasters publish on weekdays compared to weekends. Yes, over 40,000 podcast episodes are published during weekdays while on weekends, it’s within 4,000 to 5,000 episodes. The publishing time usually falls between 2 AM to 5 AM.</p><p>However, in our opinion, we don’t recommend publishing a new podcast at midnight, instead do it by 5 AM. This is will prevent the risk of your podcast getting buried under other podcasters’ shows on the app you are using, and enhance the chances of your podcast being on the first page, thus making it easily seen by your audience.</p><p><strong>2. When is the most popular publishing day?</strong></p><p>Based on the chart above, Wednesday is when the most podcast episodes are published. Over 9000 podcast episodes are published on this day, and the hour with the highest number of publishing is 2 AM.</p><p>But does this mean you should publish your podcast at exactly 2 AM on Wednesday? No! Instead, consider when your audience is most likely to listen. Will they prefer to tune in on their way to work, during work, on their way home, while doing house chores at home, or at night? You need to have a breakdown of this data, so you can choose the best time to publish your podcast.</p><p><strong>3. When is the worst?</strong></p><p>The worst day to publish a podcast is on Sunday, and as mentioned earlier, if you’re publishing during weekdays, do not publish at midnight. But note that the niche of your podcast matters. If Saturday and Sunday are when your audience tends to listen to your podcasts, then don’t hesitate to publish new episodes on weekends.</p><p>The hour with the most downloads per average episode is 5 AM Tuesday, followed by 5 AM Friday and 5 AM Thursday. Still, as mentioned earlier the time when your audience is most like to listen to the podcast matters.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Warning-Downfall-Don’t-Post-at-the-Time-Others-Do"><a href="#Part-3-Warning-Downfall-Don’t-Post-at-the-Time-Others-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Warning Downfall: Don’t Post at the Time Others Do"></a>Part 3: Warning Downfall: Don’t Post at the Time Others Do</h2><p>The charts above were published by Megaphone based on the podcast episodes published on their platform. However, if you intend to choose the days to publish a podcast based on that, then it’s sad to say you’re about to make a big mistake.</p><p>The truth is it takes time and consistency to find the best days to publish podcasts. Even successful podcasters you see today never had the best days have the best days to publish content when they started. So, before you rush to start posting your podcast based on the chart or how other podcasters upload content, here are things you should know;</p><h3 id="1-Different-podcast-platforms-have-different-algorithms"><a href="#1-Different-podcast-platforms-have-different-algorithms" class="headerlink" title="1. Different podcast platforms have different algorithms"></a>1. Different podcast platforms have different algorithms</h3><p>If you conduct an analysis of how podcast platforms work, you’ll discover all podcast platforms don’t have the same algorithm. For example, the way the Apple Podcast app works can be the same as that of Spotify, Player FM, Stitcher, and many others.</p><p>During our review of different podcast apps, we discovered Apple Podcast app algorithm tends to favor newer episodes, except if you have a show you haven’t listened to in a while. There are also podcast apps with a similar algorithm, but the best time and day to publish podcasts varies.</p><h3 id="2-What-works-for-other-podcasters-might-not-work-for-You"><a href="#2-What-works-for-other-podcasters-might-not-work-for-You" class="headerlink" title="2. What works for other podcasters might not work for You"></a>2. What works for other podcasters might not work for You</h3><p>Just as the saying goes, “One man’s food could be another man’s poison”. Many regular podcasters usually upload content today because other podcasters have done the same. But unfortunately, it’s not a good move to just do things because others are doing it in the podcasting space. So, it’s advisable not to post at the same time others do.</p><h3 id="Tips-Takeaways-to-find-the-best-day-for-your-podcast-show"><a href="#Tips-Takeaways-to-find-the-best-day-for-your-podcast-show" class="headerlink" title="Tips &amp; Takeaways to find the best day for your podcast show"></a>Tips &amp; Takeaways to find the best day for your podcast show</h3><p>We absolutely can’t help you choose the best day to release a podcast. However, the following tips could help you decide what day and time will suit your podcast show.</p><p><strong>a. Avoid times when your audience will hardly listen to your podcast</strong></p><p>Most people look for podcasts when they are looking for information conversationally. So, you must do findings on knowing when your audience will want to listen to your podcast, though research shows that more people listen to podcasts on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday between 2 AM and 5 AM. But 5 AM is the best time to gather more downloads.</p><p><strong>b. Try to tie it to something more predictable</strong></p><p>Sometimes, you just need to think out of the box when choosing the best day for your podcast. For example, we know weekdays are for going to work, and more people tend to download podcasts by 5 AM on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. So, if your podcast is about “Things you should do at work to make your day less stressful”, there’s a high chance of getting more downloads, as it’ll attract many workers facing a similar problem daily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Regularly-Produce-Podcasts-for-Posting"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Regularly-Produce-Podcasts-for-Posting" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Regularly Produce Podcasts for Posting?"></a>Part 4: How To Regularly Produce Podcasts for Posting?</h2><p>After making up your mind on the best day to release a podcast, your next move should be to start producing podcasts for posting.

That is pretty simple why they jump into the live streaming businesses. There are also lots of brands and content creators just getting started, basically learning how to live stream that run into complicated situations. How do you plan it? How can you promote it the best way?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-a-live-stream.jpg"                      alt="make a live stream"                ></p><p>There are many different things to keep in mind and in this article, we will talk about every single one so you can get started creating successful live streams. There’s no problem with admitting that the technical side of live streaming is pretty complex and a little harder to understand, but with the right guide, you’ll get there!</p><p>Now you know the basics, let’s get started!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What camera do you need?"></a>Part 1. What camera do you need?</h2><p>When you’re just starting out, you can live stream from your phone or laptop’s camera, there are also good webcams available for not a lot of money. If you do have a budget a high-end camera, for example around $2000, you can invest in the following cameras:</p><p>Panasonic GH5<br>Sony A7 II<br>Panasonic LUMIX GH4</p><p>A camcorder or webcam will work perfectly for live streaming as long as the camera able to shoot at a minimum of 720p HD, 24fps. It’s totally fine to start off with the webcam on your laptop, or a better webcam. I have used the Logitech C922 for streaming and it works like a charm. The Mevo Plus helps you on great quality when you use a mobile device. After that you run your program into a software such as OBS where you can apply filters to improve your image, which you will be using to also live stream onto the actual platform such as YouTube or Twitch. A plus is that you don’t need a memory card for streaming as you’re not recording on the camera itself.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What microphone do you need?"></a>Part 2. What microphone do you need?</h2><p>When talking about audio, it’s one of the most important elements of your overall live stream. If people are getting frustrated trying to hear what you say, they are less likely to stay. Nowadays a lot of smartphones have amazing microphones with built-in noise cancellation and echo reduction. If you’re using a laptop or desktop, we recommend an external microphone as the webcam microphones aren’t that great.</p><p>USB microphones are the best choice for at-home streaming. Fanatics will rather use XLR microphones because of its sound quality. Good XLR microphones are a lot of the times way more expensive than regular USB microphones. XLRs also need an external sound card&#x2F;audio interface to be powered to your computer, like the Focusrite Scarlett Solo, starting at around $130.</p><p>Budget microphones give you great streaming quality. The only downside is that they lack certain features like a mute button and voltage&#x2F;gain controls, which forces you to find another solution to make up for that such as using plugins in your streaming software to give more gain to your microphone and or use hotkeys to mute.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What streaming software do you need?"></a>Part 3. What streaming software do you need?</h2><p>The software you’ll be using to stream isn’t built into Windows, Mac, or any other operating systems by default. You first need to download a third-party streaming software.</p><p><strong>OBS</strong></p><p>OBS Studio is open-source software used for recording and streaming. It is free to download and use but misses some of the more advanced options that you see in paid programs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p>If you are prepared to devote time to learning its functionality, OBS Studio has a lot more strength than most of the other free software, that’s why it is so popular under content creators. You will also find other plugins that people have created to add to OBS Studio’s functionality and flexibility to enhance your recording or streaming experience.</p><p><strong>Streamlabs</strong></p><p>Streamlabs was originally a live streaming tool that streamers use with other live streaming software together. Streamlabs OBS now combines the Streamlabs tool with OBS Studio, giving you a more in-depth streaming program with a more organized user interface. Just like OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS is free to download and use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamlabs-desktop.jpg"                      alt="streamlabs"                ></p><p><strong>Nvidia ShadowPlay</strong></p><p>Nvidia ShadowPlay is designed for gamers and comes combined with Nvidia GeForce graphics cards. It allows people to stream high-quality livestreams and videos. It’s suitable for platforms such as Facebook Live, YouTube and Twitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="nivdia shadowplay"                ></p><p>ShadowPlay’s DVR-style Instant Replay mode can be used by pressing a hotkey to save the last 30 seconds of your content to your hard drive or share to Twitch or YouTube. You can manually record videos for as long as you like because ShadowPlay is hardware accelerated. You can make up to a 15-second GIFs from your ShadowPlay video to ceate highlights, edit them afterwards with color grading effects, adding music, text, and upload it to Facebook, YouTube or Vimeo.</p><p><strong>XSplit Broadcaster</strong></p><p>XSplit Broadcaster is a recording and linve software for Windows. XSplit allows you to record and stream in 4K 60fps. You can use XSplit Broadcaster to stream on all platforms you can imagine that have a live function, you can even go live on multiple stream services at the same time. The streaming software has a lot of stream management features. There’s an option to edit scenes before starting your live stream with the Scene Preview Editor.</p><p>The ability to creative your own title and tags for ease of search is outstanding. The list of compatible technology that integrates with the software and the amount of data servers there are to help accommodate your needs while streaming, no matter if you are using ethernet or WiFi, XSplit is super easy to use for gaming, recording or podcasting.</p><p><strong>Wirecast</strong></p><p>What’s cool is that you can live stream from unlimited amount of sources. Microphones, cameras, IP cameras, and more. A built-in web-browser is able to show things such as web pages as well. You can mix up to 8 separate audio tracks and add processing combined with effects to enhance the viewer experience even more. Its powerful production capabilities make it super easy to switch back and forth between different live camera feeds while mixing in prerecorded video, graphics, audio, transitions and even slides.</p><p>Wirecast enables event organizers to comine live or pre-recorded video together with audio to achieve professional results as well as individual audio tracks for separate outputs. This program comes with a stock media library with videos, background images, music and more. Wirecast lets you stream like a pro and with its high-end features. This streaming software has multi-level audio recording, and 1-17 slot multi-viewer output for more advanced level of streaming and even ISO record assistance.</p><p><strong>VidBlasterX</strong></p><p>This is one of the high-end software systems with a built-in switcher and audio mixer. You can combine any number of floating input or output modules that can be positioned anywhere you want in the user interface. The modules can be docked to other ones to create the studio design that works best for you. It’s a huge benefit for having the most customization of all the 3rd party encoder apps you can use for live streaming.</p><p>The Home &amp; Studio editions comes with community support; the Broadcast edition comes with both priority and community support as well. The VidBlasterX Trial Edition is the same as the Studio Edition, with a watermark added to all output channels. The VidblasterX website tells: “VidBlasterX is a versatile and powerful ultra-low latency cascading vision mixer and video router with built-in scalers, time base correctors, frame synchronisers, IP video encoders and decoders, video players, recorders, keyers, effects and much more.”</p><p><strong>vMix</strong></p><p>This program also allows you to create professional quality videos and live shows. vMix offers you the power to add multiple cameras angles, images, videos, audio, titles, Powerpoint presentations, chroma key, virtual sets and even more than that. You are then able to showcase, live stream and record your content all at the same time. vMix integrates with EasyWorship, Flowplayer, Facebook, Restream, Vimeo, Twitch and YouTube.</p><p>That being said, vMix has excelled in great features and looks to be coming out with even more every six months. This program has added everything you need. Their integration of dedicated Call-In features together with NDI &amp; SRT support is clearly included and is available at a very affordable price. After all, we definitely recommend anyone wanting to move from a hardware solution to this kind of a software, to give vMix a try. Especially when they offer you a full 60-day Free Trial and it’s not a limited trial version either, but rather the whole top end version that includes everything you need to boost your live streaming career off the ground!</p><p><strong>Ffmpeg</strong></p><p>When talking about Ffmpeg, we’d like to mention that this is a very basic broadcasting software compatible with Dacast’s streaming platform. From what we noticed is that Ffmpeg is very easy and quick to learn where you won’t need to open another application in order to use it. As long as you’re happy with using the command line, you can use it for video and audio conversions, compression, and many other tools included in the options. We did use it to try at video editing, after using other paid software too, like VEGAS Pro. We do agree that it’s a matter of getting used to the program. You can find anything you need online to get started, or when you are lost. It’s good that it does not claim a lot of space on the hard drive. This is a complete new way of live streaming and video editing.</p><p><strong>Restream.io</strong></p><p>You likely have heard about this program. Restream is a complete and professional live streaming application for anyone who wants to start their online career professionally. Simply stream professional broadcasts from your browser to multiple social platforms at once, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch. Customize your live streams, engage with your viewers, and drive action. They have a packed community of over 5,000,000 streamers using Restream to go broadcast live on YouTube, Facebook Twitter, LinkedIn, and more!</p><p>The most significant of all features is the Ecamm Live integration. This allows you to read the chat of different platforms from the same place. The video quality that Restream employs is the best with barely any latency and delay!</p><h2 id="Wrapping-it-up"><a href="#Wrapping-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping it up"></a>Wrapping it up</h2><p>Live streaming is quite a wide topic, and each streaming experience is different as well.

Understanding the basics together with some test runs and practice will help make your live streams way more better and valuable for the viewers.</p><p><a class="link"

If you want, you can use Google Photos to edit photos or create beautiful photo collages.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The transfer process is largely dependent on the quality of the Internet connection, and transferring images larger than 16 megapixels is not an option.</p><p> You will have to create a Google account if you already don’t have one in order to be able to successfully transfer photos and videos from your PC to an iPhone and you also must also install the Google Photos app on your iPhone.</p><h4 id="1-2"><a href="#1-2" class="headerlink" title="1\"></a>1\</h4><p> Place all the files you want to transfer into a folder and put it on your desktop in order to make sure that you don’t have to spend time trying to locate the folder.

If you’re in such a situation, you could convert the SRT file to another format that’s compatible with the app you’re using. I know the question on your mind right now is “How do I convert SRT file?” Well, that’s why we’ve created this guide.</p><p>Here, we’ve discussed the most reliable methods to convert SRT to XML, SSA, TTML, and other different formats. So, what are you waiting for?

Yes, this is because XML is a markup language based on Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), and you will require technical knowledge to understand files in such formats. The file format allows the sharing of structured information between two different programs, programs, and people, or among locally and shared networks.</p><p>The question is which online tool can convert SRT to XML? GoTranscript is the perfect SRT to XML converter that you need for this operation. This tool allows a straightforward SRT to XML conversion, and all it takes is just a few clicks. Read on to learn how to use the tool to convert SRT to XML.</p><p>Step1 Visit <a class="link"   href="https://gotranscript.com/subtitle-converter" >GoTranscript Subtitle Converter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Click the “Upload” button to upload your SRT file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-1.jpg"                      alt="convert srt to xml"                ></p><p>Step3 Select the file output format as “Flash XML (.xml)”. Then hit the “Convert” button to convert SRT to XML.</p><p>After the conversion process is finalized, you can download the XML file to your PC.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-SSA"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-SSA" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Convert SRT to SSA"></a>Part 3: How to Convert SRT to SSA</h2><p>Are you looking to convert SRT to SSA? SSA is a more advanced subtitle file format, and it’s usually used in anime fansubs to either store subtitle data with video or to overlay subtitles on video while it’s being encoded. The subtitle is not really popular among video content creators. However, when the need to convert SRT to SSA arises, an online tool is the right solution to help you get the job done without error. And luckily, the prior mentioned GoTranscipt subtitle converter also supports such a conversion process.</p><p>The steps below explain the process.</p><p>Step1 Visit <a class="link"   href="https://toolslick.com/conversion/subtitle/srt-to-ssa" >ToolSlick <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Click the “Upload” button to upload your SRT file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-2.jpg"                      alt="convert srt to ssa"                ></p><p>Step3 Click Convert to begin SRT to SSA conversion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-3.jpg"                      alt="click convert to begin srt to ssa"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, click the green Download icon to download the converted file to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-4.jpg"                      alt="clcik the green download icon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-TTML"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-TTML" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Convert SRT to TTML"></a>Part 4: How to Convert SRT to TTML</h2><p>Formerly known as DFXP (Distribution Format Exchange Profile), TTML (Time Texture Markup Language) is a time text in online media used in authoring, transcoding, or exchanging time text information used for subtitles and captions of videos. Although this format is supported in most media players, it cannot be used in web browsers. However, some people still have personal reasons why they want to convert SRT to TTML. Irrespective of what your reason to convert SRT to TTML is, you need the help of an online tool to carry out the operation.</p><p>We used the Better Converter online tool to convert SRT to TTML here. Just follow the following steps to perform the task.</p><p>Step1 Open <a class="link"   href="https://www.better-converter.com/Subtitles-Converter/Str-to-TTML-Subtitle-Converter" >Better Converter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in your browser.</p><p>Step2 Use the Browse button to upload your SRT file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-5.jpg"                      alt="use browse to upload srt file"                ></p><p>Step3 Once you upload the file, Better Converter will automatically convert it to TTML and download the file to your PC. You can find the file in the Download folder.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-SCC"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-SCC" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Convert SRT to SCC"></a>Part 5: How to Convert SRT to SCC</h2><p>There are effective steps that could also come in handy if you want to convert SRT to SCC. But first, what is SCC? SCC (Scenarist Closed Captions) is a closed caption file that is used as a sidecar file in video editing and production programs. Such programs use it in saving unrendered videos before exporting them to the final video format. Unlike SRT, this type of file format can only be opened in certain applications as it’s not a universally accepted format.</p><p>To convert SRT to SCC, you need an online converter, and here, we’ve explained the step-by-step process to convert SRT to SCC using REV online converter. It’s a reliable tool for the job.</p><p>Step1 Visit REV’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.rev.com/captionconverter" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Click on Select.SRT Files to upload the SRT file you want to convert to SCC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-6.jpg"                      alt="click on select srt files"                ></p><p>Step3 Under Select Output Formats, choose Scenarist (.scc).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-7.jpg"                      alt="choose scenarist"                ></p><p>Step4 Enter your email into the relevant box and click the Convert button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-8.jpg"                      alt="enter email into relevant box"                ></p><p>The SRT file should be converted within a few minutes. Afterward, you can check for the converted files in your email.</p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-FCPXML"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-FCPXML" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to Convert SRT to FCPXML"></a>Part 6: How to Convert SRT to FCPXML</h2><p>The FCPXML (Final Cut Pro XML) format is a totally different kind of caption file - it uses XML elements to describe data exchanged between the Final Cut Pro software and other third-party applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, LumaFusion, etc. This caption file format can only be used only on Final Cut Pro. So, if you’re looking to convert SRT to FCPXML, you also need an online tool. Although the online tool that converts SRT to FCPXML is very limited, the Resolver Tool is one that does the job correctly. However, it only works efficiently with PC. So, we advise you use a PC for this operation.</p><p>See the steps to perform the task below:</p><p>Step1 Open Resolver Tools in your PC browser.</p><p>Step2 Click on Choose File to upload the SRT file you want to convert.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-9.jpg"                      alt="click on choose file to upload"                ></p><p>Step3 Select FCPXML to SRT 1.5 and edit output as per requirement. Then, click Send File to begin SRT to FCPXML conversion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-10.jpg"                      alt="select fcpxml to srt 1.5"                ></p><p>Once the conversion is completed, the FCPXML file will be saved to the Downloads folder on your PC automatically.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>There’s no doubt that the SRT file format is one of the most popular subtitle formats that’s supported on almost all video players and social media platforms. However, there are situations when we might need to convert SRT to XML or any other subtitle format. In such cases, you can use the stepwise guides explained in this article to convert SRT.

But first, what is SCC? SCC (Scenarist Closed Captions) is a closed caption file that is used as a sidecar file in video editing and production programs. Such programs use it in saving unrendered videos before exporting them to the final video format. Unlike SRT, this type of file format can only be opened in certain applications as it’s not a universally accepted format.</p><p>To convert SRT to SCC, you need an online converter, and here, we’ve explained the step-by-step process to convert SRT to SCC using REV online converter.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-Seamless-Audio-Transitions-in-Audacity"><a href="#Mastering-Seamless-Audio-Transitions-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Mastering Seamless Audio Transitions in Audacity"></a>Mastering Seamless Audio Transitions in Audacity</h2><p>You may choose from a wide variety of audio editing tools. It’s really free to utilize one of the most well-liked ones. You want to make your voice better for your next audio production, right? You most likely searched the internet and came across some cool audio program named Audacity. Mix tracks or add effects to your recordings to edit your audio utilizing the cut, copy, and paste tools with limitless undo capability.</p><p>For audio analysis applications, Audacity additionally has an integrated amplitude-envelope editor, a customizable spectrogram mode, and a frequency-analysis window. The ideal way to get started in the realm of audio editing is using Audacity. It was created by volunteers using open-source software. With Audacity, you can do a lot of things, such trim files to make them shorter, take away background noise, cut out silence, change volume, and more. The drop-down menu located underneath the sound level meters on top allows you to rapidly choose between the numerous audio sources.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Crossfade"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Crossfade" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Crossfade?"></a>Part 1. What is Crossfade?</h2><p>Crossfading process allows two sounds to segue smoothly into one another. Crossfading is an audio effect that is often used in audio engineering to merge two or more sounds in a song gradually rather than suddenly. This method is mostly used to prevent any abrupt silences between two songs, which might disturb listeners. As a result of the development of the computer-based digital audio editor, crossfading became more straightforward.</p><p>When you cross fade music, you cause one piece of audio to fade out—the sound gradually vanishes—at the precise same moment as another piece of audio fades in—the sound gradually manifests. This effect produces a seamless transition between the two songs without any abrupt pauses or quiet in between. The volume of audio in the source files is the sole restriction on the duration of the fade in a digital editor that supports crossfading between two or more files.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Use-Crossfading-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Use-Crossfading-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Use Crossfading in Audacity"></a>Part 2. How To Use Crossfading in Audacity</h2><p>Don’t be intimidated by the capabilities of this audio program. Before the first event completely vanishes into the second, the crossfade gradually transitions by overlaying the events at the transition point so that both are seen or heard at the same time. Using Audacity, it’s easy to reduce some of the background noise in your audio track. You must create a noise profile to do this. We’ve put up a helpful guide on how to use Audacity to enhance your audio productions.</p><p><strong>Steps to Use Audacity Crossfade</strong>:</p><p>Step1 Select File, Import, and Audio from the menu. You may choose one or more audio files, and Audacity will automatically import them into the current project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/import-audio-into-audacity.jpg"                      alt="import audio into audacity"                ></p><p>Step2 Select File, followed by Recent files. The first of the 12 most recent saved or imported files will be imported if you do this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-import-recent-files.jpg"                      alt="select import recent files"                ></p><p>Step3 Use your Selection tool to align the clips so that a crossfade will be applied between two clips on different tracks. Go to Effect &gt; Crossfade Songs, place the cursor where you want the fade to begin, then drag it across the tracks you wish to blend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossfade-songs-audacity.jpg"                      alt="crossfade songs audacity"                ></p><p>Step4 Using the Time Shift Tool, place your two clips adjacent to one another in order to apply a crossfade across them on the same track. Select the area to be crossfaded using the Selection tool, and then click Effect &gt; Crossfade Clips to combine the sounds you’ve chosen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/combine-sound-clips-audacity.jpg"                      alt="combine sound clips audacity"                ></p><p>Step5 This project should be exported as an MP3. Once you’ve finished editing, choose File &gt; Export &gt; Export as MP3 from the menu. From this point on, a pop-up window with a number of fields will appear, allowing you to choose how the file is saved.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.
