    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-the-Role-of-Alternate-Footage"><a href="#Mastering-the-Role-of-Alternate-Footage" class="headerlink" title="Mastering the Role of Alternate Footage"></a>Mastering the Role of Alternate Footage</h2><p>B roll is a phrase used to describe supplemental video, which is frequently used as cutaway video to add visuals and context to your tale. The phrase dates back to the earliest days of Hollywood when movies were still being made on film. The main roll of film was called the A-roll, and a second roll of film called the B roll, or B-reel, was used for cutaway shots and transitions.</p><p>Now that we know that, let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies"><a href="#1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies" class="headerlink" title="1. B roll In TV And Movies"></a>1. B roll In TV And Movies</h2><p>Broll is an acronym for “background” or “behind,” respectively. It usually refers to extra footage captured with a movie camera while keeping the lighting consistent between scenes in the movie industry. When the filmmaker doesn’t want to show any dialogue or action on screen but needs some movement within the frame, it might be utilized as filler.</p><p>B roll has been used from the first silent movies, including D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film “Intolerance.” Griffith’s creative application All of the shots that are used in a movie or television show are collectively referred to as “b roll footage.” To add context and complexity to the production being recorded, these shots are frequently seen on screen in quick succession.</p><p>B roll can be utilized for establishing shots as well as close-ups of items. It is used by filmmakers when they lack the funds for pricey films or when they want to showcase their originality. It’s also a fantastic method for narrating stories devoid of conversation. It might be anything, such a view of a landscape or a person’s hands holding up a sign with words on it.</p><p>For instance, wider shots are frequently used when someone is giving a speech while seated behind a podium so that we can see both them and their surroundings, such as audience members standing close and applauding or security personnel.</p><h2 id="2-Methods-to-use-b-roll"><a href="#2-Methods-to-use-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods to use b roll"></a>2. Methods to use b roll</h2><p>Now that there are so many stock footage platforms, you have a lot of choices when you need just the right scene for your project. Most of the time, filmmakers don’t use B roll footage. One good way to use it is to use it as a way to move from one scene to the next. It can also be used to set the mood for an event or show what time of day it is when filming.</p><p>The ideal way to use B roll is to put it behind interviews. This kind of footage can be used in three ways: as establishing shots, cutaways, and transitions. Most of the time, the first few minutes of an interview or video help set the scene with “establishing shots.”</p><p>On the other hand, cutaways can show how different people react to what is being said in an interview. After all, transitions are commonly used to switch from one person’s experience with a certain topic to another person’s experience with the same topic. All of these different kinds of footage give filmmakers and videographers more freedom to tell their stories without relying too much on dialogue or narration.</p><h2 id="3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3. What types of b roll are there?"></a>3. What types of b roll are there?</h2><p>We’ll examine the top 5 uses for B rolls across a variety of video genres and discuss how to implement them effectively in your own projects.</p><h3 id="1-Archival-b-roll-footage"><a href="#1-Archival-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Archival b roll footage"></a>1. Archival b roll footage</h3><p>Aerial B roll is the solution when you like to show your viewers where your film is being recorded or when you are changing locations and want them to know it. The plane takes off and lands in another city, and then shots of the city, its landmarks, its famous streets, etc. are shown. You have probably seen this type of B roll footage in movies and TV shows. These images aid in putting the viewer in the character’s current location. Check out this collection of setting images from the Neighbors television series.</p><h3 id="2-Visual-detail-b-roll-footage"><a href="#2-Visual-detail-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="2. Visual detail b roll footage"></a>2. Visual detail b roll footage</h3><p>Including archival material in your video allows your audience to experience a previously covered or historically significant story as it occurred. Look at this illustration from Netflix’s 14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible, which was made utilizing old b roll film from the era to help the viewer connect with the narrative.</p><h3 id="3-Storytelling-b-roll-footage"><a href="#3-Storytelling-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="3. Storytelling b roll footage"></a>3. Storytelling b roll footage</h3><p>B roll footage can be used to tell a story that supports the narrative of your video. For example, in this video interview of Tom DeLonge, the speaker talks about living in a neighborhood. The B rolls show him driving around in his car, skateboarding on the street in the 90’s. These add to the story the video creator wants to talk about not seeing people with a disability differently.</p><h3 id="4-Undirected-b-roll-footage"><a href="#4-Undirected-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="4. Undirected b roll footage"></a>4. Undirected b roll footage</h3><p>This particular kind of B roll film is captured without any direction being given to your character, as the name suggests. For the purposes of an interview video, for instance, these can be straightforward close-up views of your character’s hands and facial expressions. On the other hand, while you’re doing a documentary, you might record your subject participating in everyday activities.</p><h3 id="5-Atmospheric-b-roll-footage"><a href="#5-Atmospheric-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="5. Atmospheric b roll footage"></a>5. Atmospheric b roll footage</h3><p>When you are sharing a narrative that has been told in the past or that has historical significance, incorporating archival material into your video gives your audience the opportunity to see the story as it occurred at the time. This is especially useful when you are discussing a narrative that has been experienced in the past or that has futuristic relevance.</p><p>Have a look at the scenes from the episode “14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible” that can be found on Netflix. As a result of the use of archive film footage of b roll from the relevant time period in its production, the audience is able to connect with the narrative on a deeper level.</p><h3 id="6-Pick-up-shots"><a href="#6-Pick-up-shots" class="headerlink" title="6. Pick-up shots"></a>6. Pick-up shots</h3><p>A pick-up is a tiny shot added to previously captured material. Re-shoots involve redoing entire scenes. Both types of shots are commonly added during film editing to fix, logic, continuity, or quality flaws. These photos happen a while after the sets have been taken down, clothes and props stowed, and the actors and crew have gone on to new projects.</p><p>If flaws were discovered during primary photography, the directors could have requested another take. The producer and director should weigh the cost of rejoining cast and crew against the need for pick-ups or re-shoots to address storyline flaws (or worse) in the final edit.</p><h3 id="7-A-roll-vs-b-roll"><a href="#7-A-roll-vs-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="7. A roll vs b roll"></a>7. A roll vs b roll</h3><p>Imagine the A roll as part of the video’s story. This could be a documentary film, news show, or scripted sketch. Everything else on your editing table must be rearranged to fit it. When the speaker in the following video is directly talking to the camera or interviewer, this is A roll footage. The video’s most crucial segments were filmed with primary footage.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We sincerely hope that this post will be of use to you in making your films more cinematic. You not only know how to film and edit your videos utilizing B rolls, you also have an extremely effective hack that allows you to generate amazing videos using stock footage. This is both impressive and unique.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-quick-video-wins-essential-ideas-for-vloggers/"><u>[New] Quick Video Wins  Essential Ideas for Vloggers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-samsung-tips-easy-time-lapse-photography/"><u>2024 Approved  Samsung Tips  Easy Time-Lapse Photography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-olympic-highlights-thrilling-runs-from-x-games/"><u>[Updated] Olympic Highlights  Thrilling Runs From X Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-photoshopping-magic-deformation-tips/"><u>In 2024, Photoshopping Magic  Deformation Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-snap-share-and-shine-your-guide-to-dynamic-gif-creation/"><u>[Updated] Snap, Share & Shine  Your Guide to Dynamic GIF Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-inside-look-prospects-and-pitfalls-of-samsung-image-processor-2023/"><u>[New] Inside Look  Prospects & Pitfalls of Samsung Image Processor, 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-pinnacle-20-anime-songs-to-start-with/"><u>[Updated] Pinnacle 20 Anime Songs to Start With</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-photography-tutorial-how-to-shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits/"><u>2024 Approved  Photography Tutorial  How to Shoot and Create Impressive HDR Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-redefining-high-definition-a-review-of-the-immersive-4k-monitor-lgs-31mu97-b/"><u>[New] Redefining High Definition  A Review of the Immersive 4K Monitor, LG's 31MU97-B</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-instagram-meets-tiktok-syncing-social-media/"><u>[New] Instagram Meets TikTok  Syncing Social Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/in-2024-detailed-steps-to-rotate-videos-in-blender/"><u>In 2024, Detailed Steps to Rotate Videos in Blender</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-leading-music-editors-for-iphones-and-android-devices-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Leading Music Editors for iPhones and Android Devices – A Comprehensive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-gaming-without-limits-screen-recorder-alternatives-explained-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Gaming Without Limits  Screen Recorder Alternatives Explained for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-great-debate-should-you-go-for-obs-or-bandicam-in-2024/"><u>[New] The Great Debate  Should You Go for OBS or Bandicam, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/perfecting-hdr-photos-techniques-for-blending-in-lightroom/"><u>Perfecting HDR Photos  Techniques for Blending in Lightroom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-masterclass-top-10-recorder-options-on-spotify/"><u>[Updated] Masterclass Top 10 Recorder Options on Spotify</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/2024-approved-use-your-social-media-app-and-make-slow-motion-videos-by-reading-this-guide-besides-learning-slow-motion-snapchat-get-useful-apps-serving-the-/"><u>2024 Approved Use Your Social Media App and Make Slow-Motion Videos by Reading This Guide.

However, before you start sharing your tunes, you must ensure you understand its music copyright rules.</p><p>In this article, we’ll give you a comprehensive guide to understanding <strong>Instagram’s rules about copyright music.</strong> We’ll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.</p><h2 id="How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music"><a href="#How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music" class="headerlink" title="How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?"></a>How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?</h2><p>Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the system is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.</p><p>Instagram’s recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.</p><p>Here’s what happens to your Instagram account if the system detects copyrighted content:</p><ul><li>Your post may be muted on Instagram.</li><li>Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you’re broadcasting a track during a Livestream.</li><li>Instagram may take down your post entirely.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copyright-music-on-instagram-1.jpg"                      alt="instagram copyright notification"                ></p><h2 id="Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules"><a href="#Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Music Copyright Rules"></a>Instagram Music Copyright Rules</h2><p>Below are the three general copyright principles you should keep in mind when using music on Instagram:</p><ul><li><strong>Apply A Video When Sharing Music:</strong> Instagram allows you to share a recording of an artist or band performing live and applying music to a short video.</li><li><strong>Keep The Video Short:</strong> Make sure your video is short because if you post a more extended clip with copyrighted music, Instagram’s detection system will limit your content.</li><li><strong>Unlimited Music For Your Instagram Stories:</strong> If you share a story on Instagram, the platform allows you to add unlimited copyrighted music to it from its built-in music library.</li></ul><h3 id="1-How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram"><a href="#1-How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="(1) How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram"></a>(1) How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram</h3><p>There are several workarounds for using <strong>copyrighted music on Instagram:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborating With Artists Or Musicians:</strong> Reach out to local musicians or new artists to see if you can collaborate and create custom sounds for your Instagram videos. Not only will you have copyright-free music that you can use, but you will also support independent artists!</li><li><strong>Asking For Permission:</strong> To avoid copyright issues on Instagram, you can contact the creator to seek permission before using their content.</li><li><strong>Pay For The Copyrighted Music:</strong> You can opt to pay for royalty-free music on your IG posts, live streams, or IGTV from various online libraries, such as <a class="link"   href="https://pixabay.com/" >Pixaby, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://soundcloud.com/" >SoundCloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/" >Apple Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li><strong>Give Credit In Your Caption:</strong> To use copyrighted music on your IG content, make sure to give credit to the original creator in your post’s caption.</li><li><strong>Post Instagram Reel Videos:</strong> Reels are short videos of about 15 seconds with a built-in music feature that applies a sticker to your content with the song’s details and can save you from Instagram copyright music issues.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Using-Filmora-To-Avoid-Copyright-Issue-And-Post-Your-Videos-On-Instagram"><a href="#2-Using-Filmora-To-Avoid-Copyright-Issue-And-Post-Your-Videos-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="(2) Using Filmora To Avoid Copyright Issue And Post Your Videos On Instagram"></a>(2) Using Filmora To Avoid Copyright Issue And Post Your Videos On Instagram</h3><p>Copyright can be a tricky thing, especially when it comes to posting music videos on Instagram.

And as we all know, digital cameras can only capture images with differentiation in a specific range of luminosity.</p><p>You need reliable HDR software to be able to create HDR images. Luminance HDR is one of the top software that many people want to have at their fingertips. But is the tool worth it? Does it have all it takes to satisfy your HDR image creation and editing needs? Well, this post has the right answers to these questions and lots more. So, stick around to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Luminance-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Luminance-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Summary Box on Luminance HDR"></a>Part 1: Summary Box on Luminance HDR</h2><p>Luminance HDR is a digital graphics software that is used for the creation and editing of ‘High Dynamic Range Images. Formerly known as Qtpfsgui, this tool is a free and open-source program that not only facilitates the workflow for HDR imaging but also LDR imaging.</p><p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Highly effective, but with some confusing features.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Windows, Mac OS, Linux</p><p><strong>Ease to use:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Creating and editing HDR images</p><p><strong>Value for Money:</strong> The tool is free</p><p><strong>Support:</strong> 0&#x2F;5</p><p><strong>Our Verdict:</strong> Luminance HDR is a very effective HDR software with a wide range of functionalities.</p><p>The tool boasts up to six photo blending algorithms for users to take advantage of in a fairly responsive interface.</p><p>It supports a wide range of decent features ranging from alignment to deghosting, EV-based histogram, and lots more. But the only thing is some features are confusing, making it quite challenging.</p><p>Also, enabling features like ‘alignment and deghosting could cause the program to crash.</p><p><strong>What we like</strong></p><ul><li>It offers a wide range of functionalities despite being a free and open-source tool.</li><li>High compatibility with both Mac and Windows computers.</li><li>Allows Batch HDR merging.</li><li>It can read images in RAW, JPEG, PNG, and lots more formats smoothly.</li><li>The tool supports lots of helpful features that users can always take advantage of in both the fusion stage and tone mapping stage.</li><li>Support up to six photo blending algorithms.</li><li>The tool support multiple languages.</li></ul><p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p><ul><li>Some of its features are confusing.</li><li>The interface could be better.</li></ul><p>HDR expands the range of contrasts and color of images significantly. Thus, making bright sides brighter and colors become expanded so every detail of the images would be seen without stress.</p><p>Besides, there are various HDR formats including Dolby vision, generic, and lots more. It is even used in TVs to enrich colors with content that supports it.</p><p>Since HDR photography requires a narrow range of digital images with multiple exposures, it’s essential you have the right HDR software at your fingertips to be able to calculate the high contrast image, combine the images, and do lots more efficiently.</p><p>That being said, let’s dive into a detailed review on Luminance HDR to find out more about how the tool can help users in their endeavors to create&#x2F;edit HDR images</p><h2 id="Part-2-Review-in-detail-on-Luminance-HDR"><a href="#Part-2-Review-in-detail-on-Luminance-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Review in detail on Luminance HDR"></a>Part 2: Review in detail on Luminance HDR</h2><p>Luminance HDR software is a free tool and it offers users a simple way to create and edit HDR images efficiently.

From resizing to cropping, rotating, etc. Keep reading to know more about the editing featured on Luminance HDR.</p><p><strong>Resize:</strong> ‘Resize’ can be used to resize HDR images to a preferred pixel or percentage value just by clicking the ‘Scale’ button.</p><p>To utilize this feature, just navigate to Edit and select ‘Resize’ from the menu. Then enter a value in percentage or pixel and click the ‘Scale’ button to resize your HDR image instantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luminance-hdr-3.jpg"                      alt="image resize luminance hdr"                ></p><p><strong>Crop:</strong> Once you upload your HDR image to Luminous HDR, you can just click anywhere on it, then drag the mouse pointer that appears to a side and release it to crop the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luminance-hdr-6.jpg"                      alt="image crop luminance hdr 1"                ></p><p>Also, you can use the ‘Crop’ feature to edit the frame you created by dragging its corners. After you’ve edited the HDR image frame to the required level, you can crop it using the relevant button in the toolbar or use the ‘Edit’ option to select ‘Crop to Selection’ in the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luminance-hdr-1.jpg"                      alt="image resize luminance hdr 2"                ></p><p><strong>Rotate:</strong> Rotate HDR images up to 90 degrees by using the &lt; and &gt; shortcuts or the ‘Clockwise’ and ‘Counter-Clockwise’ commands under the Edit menu.

The creation and tone mapping of HDR images are interactive using GUI, and images can be enhanced using quality features. The image loading speed is quite fair. So, in all, we could say the Luminance HDR processing is reliable.</p><ol><li>UI and Layout</li></ol><p>The Luminous HDR interface is fairly responsive, but some of the features are quite confusing, making it challenging. Users can set a preferred interface theme and set it if they want it to always show in the preview panel window.</p><p>Also, you can utilize ‘Portable’ mode to put the Luminous HDR application on a USB stick with its settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luminance-hdr-5.jpg"                      alt="luminance hdr interface"                ></p><p><strong>Pro Tips: How to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop?</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, Luminous HDR is limited to only editing HDR images.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Maximizing-Viewership-Live-Stream-Optimization-Techniques"><a href="#Maximizing-Viewership-Live-Stream-Optimization-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Maximizing Viewership: Live Stream Optimization Techniques"></a>Maximizing Viewership: Live Stream Optimization Techniques</h2><p>In today’s day and age, over 59% of all marketing agencies are live streaming their content for the most reach. That is pretty simple why they jump into the live streaming businesses. There are also lots of brands and content creators just getting started, basically learning how to live stream that run into complicated situations. How do you plan it? How can you promote it the best way?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-a-live-stream.jpg"                      alt="make a live stream"                ></p><p>There are many different things to keep in mind and in this article, we will talk about every single one so you can get started creating successful live streams. There’s no problem with admitting that the technical side of live streaming is pretty complex and a little harder to understand, but with the right guide, you’ll get there!</p><p>Now you know the basics, let’s get started!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What camera do you need?"></a>Part 1. What camera do you need?</h2><p>When you’re just starting out, you can live stream from your phone or laptop’s camera, there are also good webcams available for not a lot of money. If you do have a budget a high-end camera, for example around $2000, you can invest in the following cameras:</p><p>Panasonic GH5<br>Sony A7 II<br>Panasonic LUMIX GH4</p><p>A camcorder or webcam will work perfectly for live streaming as long as the camera able to shoot at a minimum of 720p HD, 24fps. It’s totally fine to start off with the webcam on your laptop, or a better webcam. I have used the Logitech C922 for streaming and it works like a charm. The Mevo Plus helps you on great quality when you use a mobile device. After that you run your program into a software such as OBS where you can apply filters to improve your image, which you will be using to also live stream onto the actual platform such as YouTube or Twitch. A plus is that you don’t need a memory card for streaming as you’re not recording on the camera itself.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What microphone do you need?"></a>Part 2. What microphone do you need?</h2><p>When talking about audio, it’s one of the most important elements of your overall live stream. If people are getting frustrated trying to hear what you say, they are less likely to stay. Nowadays a lot of smartphones have amazing microphones with built-in noise cancellation and echo reduction. If you’re using a laptop or desktop, we recommend an external microphone as the webcam microphones aren’t that great.</p><p>USB microphones are the best choice for at-home streaming. Fanatics will rather use XLR microphones because of its sound quality. Good XLR microphones are a lot of the times way more expensive than regular USB microphones. XLRs also need an external sound card&#x2F;audio interface to be powered to your computer, like the Focusrite Scarlett Solo, starting at around $130.</p><p>Budget microphones give you great streaming quality. The only downside is that they lack certain features like a mute button and voltage&#x2F;gain controls, which forces you to find another solution to make up for that such as using plugins in your streaming software to give more gain to your microphone and or use hotkeys to mute.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What streaming software do you need?"></a>Part 3. What streaming software do you need?</h2><p>The software you’ll be using to stream isn’t built into Windows, Mac, or any other operating systems by default. You first need to download a third-party streaming software.</p><p><strong>OBS</strong></p><p>OBS Studio is open-source software used for recording and streaming. It is free to download and use but misses some of the more advanced options that you see in paid programs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p>If you are prepared to devote time to learning its functionality, OBS Studio has a lot more strength than most of the other free software, that’s why it is so popular under content creators. You will also find other plugins that people have created to add to OBS Studio’s functionality and flexibility to enhance your recording or streaming experience.</p><p><strong>Streamlabs</strong></p><p>Streamlabs was originally a live streaming tool that streamers use with other live streaming software together. Streamlabs OBS now combines the Streamlabs tool with OBS Studio, giving you a more in-depth streaming program with a more organized user interface. Just like OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS is free to download and use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamlabs-desktop.jpg"                      alt="streamlabs"                ></p><p><strong>Nvidia ShadowPlay</strong></p><p>Nvidia ShadowPlay is designed for gamers and comes combined with Nvidia GeForce graphics cards. It allows people to stream high-quality livestreams and videos. It’s suitable for platforms such as Facebook Live, YouTube and Twitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="nivdia shadowplay"                ></p><p>ShadowPlay’s DVR-style Instant Replay mode can be used by pressing a hotkey to save the last 30 seconds of your content to your hard drive or share to Twitch or YouTube. You can manually record videos for as long as you like because ShadowPlay is hardware accelerated. You can make up to a 15-second GIFs from your ShadowPlay video to ceate highlights, edit them afterwards with color grading effects, adding music, text, and upload it to Facebook, YouTube or Vimeo.</p><p><strong>XSplit Broadcaster</strong></p><p>XSplit Broadcaster is a recording and linve software for Windows. XSplit allows you to record and stream in 4K 60fps. You can use XSplit Broadcaster to stream on all platforms you can imagine that have a live function, you can even go live on multiple stream services at the same time. The streaming software has a lot of stream management features. There’s an option to edit scenes before starting your live stream with the Scene Preview Editor.</p><p>The ability to creative your own title and tags for ease of search is outstanding. The list of compatible technology that integrates with the software and the amount of data servers there are to help accommodate your needs while streaming, no matter if you are using ethernet or WiFi, XSplit is super easy to use for gaming, recording or podcasting.</p><p><strong>Wirecast</strong></p><p>What’s cool is that you can live stream from unlimited amount of sources. Microphones, cameras, IP cameras, and more. A built-in web-browser is able to show things such as web pages as well. You can mix up to 8 separate audio tracks and add processing combined with effects to enhance the viewer experience even more. Its powerful production capabilities make it super easy to switch back and forth between different live camera feeds while mixing in prerecorded video, graphics, audio, transitions and even slides.</p><p>Wirecast enables event organizers to comine live or pre-recorded video together with audio to achieve professional results as well as individual audio tracks for separate outputs. This program comes with a stock media library with videos, background images, music and more. Wirecast lets you stream like a pro and with its high-end features. This streaming software has multi-level audio recording, and 1-17 slot multi-viewer output for more advanced level of streaming and even ISO record assistance.</p><p><strong>VidBlasterX</strong></p><p>This is one of the high-end software systems with a built-in switcher and audio mixer. You can combine any number of floating input or output modules that can be positioned anywhere you want in the user interface. The modules can be docked to other ones to create the studio design that works best for you. It’s a huge benefit for having the most customization of all the 3rd party encoder apps you can use for live streaming.</p><p>The Home &amp; Studio editions comes with community support; the Broadcast edition comes with both priority and community support as well. The VidBlasterX Trial Edition is the same as the Studio Edition, with a watermark added to all output channels. The VidblasterX website tells: “VidBlasterX is a versatile and powerful ultra-low latency cascading vision mixer and video router with built-in scalers, time base correctors, frame synchronisers, IP video encoders and decoders, video players, recorders, keyers, effects and much more.”</p><p><strong>vMix</strong></p><p>This program also allows you to create professional quality videos and live shows. vMix offers you the power to add multiple cameras angles, images, videos, audio, titles, Powerpoint presentations, chroma key, virtual sets and even more than that. You are then able to showcase, live stream and record your content all at the same time. vMix integrates with EasyWorship, Flowplayer, Facebook, Restream, Vimeo, Twitch and YouTube.</p><p>That being said, vMix has excelled in great features and looks to be coming out with even more every six months. This program has added everything you need. Their integration of dedicated Call-In features together with NDI &amp; SRT support is clearly included and is available at a very affordable price. After all, we definitely recommend anyone wanting to move from a hardware solution to this kind of a software, to give vMix a try. Especially when they offer you a full 60-day Free Trial and it’s not a limited trial version either, but rather the whole top end version that includes everything you need to boost your live streaming career off the ground!</p><p><strong>Ffmpeg</strong></p><p>When talking about Ffmpeg, we’d like to mention that this is a very basic broadcasting software compatible with Dacast’s streaming platform. From what we noticed is that Ffmpeg is very easy and quick to learn where you won’t need to open another application in order to use it. As long as you’re happy with using the command line, you can use it for video and audio conversions, compression, and many other tools included in the options. We did use it to try at video editing, after using other paid software too, like VEGAS Pro. We do agree that it’s a matter of getting used to the program. You can find anything you need online to get started, or when you are lost. It’s good that it does not claim a lot of space on the hard drive. This is a complete new way of live streaming and video editing.</p><p><strong>Restream.io</strong></p><p>You likely have heard about this program. Restream is a complete and professional live streaming application for anyone who wants to start their online career professionally. Simply stream professional broadcasts from your browser to multiple social platforms at once, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch. Customize your live streams, engage with your viewers, and drive action.

This allows you to read the chat of different platforms from the same place. The video quality that Restream employs is the best with barely any latency and delay!</p><h2 id="Wrapping-it-up"><a href="#Wrapping-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping it up"></a>Wrapping it up</h2><p>Live streaming is quite a wide topic, and each streaming experience is different as well. We made this article to give you a very neutral feel how to go live stream.

One of the shortcomings of Windows Movie Maker is that GoPro or action camera footage can’t be directly imported into the program.

Auto Synchronization tool.</strong><br>Usually, when you shoot a video from a little farther apart, the voice will be very low and there will be a lot of noise hence very less sound will be recorded properly. To avoid audio issues, we try to take a cell phone in our pocket or hand and the distance of the camera does not affect the video and audio. Especially in prank videos, people have hidden cameras which is difficult to record proper audio. For this, we use a cell phone to record audio separately and video separately.<br>Can you imagine how difficult it is to sync audio with video?<br>Filmora has made it much easy.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Investing-Time-Wisely-on-Cover-Art-Creation"><a href="#Investing-Time-Wisely-on-Cover-Art-Creation" class="headerlink" title="Investing Time Wisely on Cover Art Creation"></a>Investing Time Wisely on Cover Art Creation</h2><p>Research suggests people make up their mind within 90 seconds after the initial interaction with the brand and associate it as either bad or good. Many podcasters only focus on the podcast’s content, which they should, but ignore the visual identity of the podcast.</p><p>In this guide, we will guide you to design a stunning and unique podcast cover. But before that, we will acquaint you with all the necessary elements of an eye-catching podcast cover image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast cover image"                ></p><h2 id="Round-Up-10-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art"><a href="#Round-Up-10-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art" class="headerlink" title="Round-Up 10 Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art"></a>Round-Up 10 Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art</h2><p>These are not tips but 101 guides on podcast cover-making. All the ten key points mentioned here will enable you to create a podcast cover image that stands out and catch the user’s attention.</p><h3 id="1-Make-sure-the-podcast-cover-meets-podcast-platform-requirements"><a href="#1-Make-sure-the-podcast-cover-meets-podcast-platform-requirements" class="headerlink" title="1. Make sure the podcast cover meets podcast platform requirements"></a>1. Make sure the podcast cover meets podcast platform requirements</h3><p>To make your podcast accessible to people worldwide, you have to publish them to podcast platforms, otherwise known as podcast directories. For instance, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts are podcast directories.</p><p>The good thing is most podcast directories have a similar requirement for the podcast cover art dimensions, resolution, and file type. Still, some podcast directories have special needs. So, ensure to know the requirement of each podcast directory that you plan to publish your podcasts on and select the canvas accordingly.</p><p>For instance, the podcast cover size demanded by Apple Podcast is:</p><ul><li>3000 x 3000 pixels</li><li>Resolution of 72 dpi</li><li>JPG or PNG file type</li><li>RGB color-space</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-2.jpg"                      alt="apple podcast cover image"                ></p><p>Google Podcasts, a popular podcast platform among Android users, also has the same or similar requirements for the podcast cover image. That is to say, you do not have to design a podcast cover exclusive to Google Podcasts.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are some platforms that have different requirements. For instance, Spotify mentions the following need for a podcast cover image:</p><ul><li>TIFF, PNG, or JPG format using loss-less encoding</li><li>The highest resolution available</li><li>At least 640px wide and tall</li><li>1:1 aspect ratio</li><li>Encoded with an sRGB color space, 24bits per pixel, with color profiles applied directly.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: The thing to remember is to design podcast covers for all platforms with different requirements. It may seem daunting, but limitations and provisions often unleash a person’s creativity. Needless to say, if you are a professional podcaster and your teammates responsible for podcast cover making, then you can leave it to them.</p><h3 id="2-Straight-to-the-point"><a href="#2-Straight-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="2. Straight to the point"></a>2. Straight to the point</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-3.jpg"                      alt="podcast straight to the point image"                ></p><p>People often confuse “straight to the point” with plain and simple. However, it is an unjust explanation of what is straight to the point. Additionally, achieving the “straight to the point” scale is not simple.</p><p>Put, “straight to the point” means something that best projects your podcast theme with a user who has never even engaged with your podcast. For instance, if your podcast discusses movies, then do not simply design a podcast cover with the blockbuster sign.</p><p>Instead, brainstorm ideas for what you often differ in the podcast, like a specific genre or movie series. Once you narrow down the ideas, you can design a podcast cover that is straight to the point, i.e., it conveys the message creatively.</p><p>Here are some examples to help you think in the “straight to the point” fashion:</p><p><strong>Example #1 ― Entrepreneurs like it simple, plain, and sophisticated.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-4.jpg"                      alt="podcast straight to the point image"                ></p><p>The above podcast cover designs are related to business. If you carefully review each of them, you will find the human element. The human element is a necessary factor in business-related podcasts. It is what allows business professionals to connect with the experts and attracts them to the podcasts.</p><p>Another thing to review is the color palettes used by the entrepreneurs. The colors used in the podcast cover photos by hosts are often subtle yet bright and reek of sophistication.</p><p><strong>Example #2 ― Comedians Making the Most from Their Podcast Cover Photos.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-5.jpg"                      alt="podcast comedy covers"                ></p><p>Comedy podcasts don’t seem like much, but they have a huge user following. Do you know how? Well, they attract users in bulk with their funky, impressive, and immersive cover images. Notice the clever use of colors on all the podcast cover designs. Moreover, the typography used in these cover images is also unsophisticated and often conveys that this isn’t something serious.</p><h3 id="3-Avoid-Inappropriate-Words-or-Imagery"><a href="#3-Avoid-Inappropriate-Words-or-Imagery" class="headerlink" title="3. Avoid Inappropriate Words or Imagery"></a>3. Avoid Inappropriate Words or Imagery</h3><p>Swearing and inappropriate imagery is part of today’s taboo culture. However, it offends users. You have to retain that the podcast-listening community is an informed one. It’s not about becoming cool, but it’s about delivering cool information.</p><p>Not to mention, using explicit languages is also restricted by podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. So, you may also get banned for using offensive words or imagery in your podcast cover photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-6.jpg"                      alt="podcast explicit covers"                ></p><p>The recent policies of podcast directories like Apple Podcast have changed drastically. For instance, you could have gotten away with using asterisk marks in some words (like sh*t); however, it is not the case today. Your podcast will receive multiple notifications from the platform managers to remove the banner, and in some cases, the directories can also ban you from the platform. So, it is best to play it safe and use professional language, at least in the podcast cover photos.</p><h3 id="4-Color-Matters"><a href="#4-Color-Matters" class="headerlink" title="4. Color Matters"></a>4. Color Matters</h3><p>There are trends in book cover design and movie cover design, and then comes the trends in podcast cover design. You will be surprised to know the amount of time each podcaster spent on deciding the right color for the cover art.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-7.jpg"                      alt="podcast colors covers"                ></p><p>Color is something that not many businesses pay attention to, but it has a profound effect on users. To just give you an example of how deep businesses think about the color of their business, there is a separate domain after colors: color branding.</p><p>Yes, businesses spent a lot of brainstorming sessions to combine color theory and business. Here are some of the most prominent trends in the podcast world today and their significance:</p><p><strong>Example # 1. Red background with light text</strong></p><p>If you are into sales, you might already be familiar with the concept of red. Basically, red is the color of love, excitement, and anger. And the combination of these emotions allows businesses to create a sense of urgency among users. You can use the same psychology in the podcast world and let new users discover you through this psychological trick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-8.jpg"                      alt="podcast red covers"                ></p><p>Today, almost all domains in the podcast world use the red color and combine it with black or white text to entice users about their podcast episodes. You can find such podcast covers on topics ranging from history to anthropology, psychology to music, and so on.</p><p><strong>Example #2. Blue background with light text</strong></p><p>Blue is the color of trust, competency, and quality. To loosely translate its psychological effects on an average human, blue creates a sense of dependability, logic, and peace. So, if your podcast is on medical topics or something calm, a blue podcast cover photo is the way to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-9.jpg"                      alt="podcast blue covers"                ></p><p>There are numerous other examples like this. For instance, even black ink on a grey palette is a trend. After studying their psychological effects on your users, you can choose from any number of colors and combinations.</p><p>It is important to retain that color psychology is not about tricking people. Instead, it is about learning the effects of color on people mind’s and using one that best describes your episodes. So, research this in-depth and choose a color that resonates with your content and also impresses users.</p><h3 id="5-Typography-will-help"><a href="#5-Typography-will-help" class="headerlink" title="5. Typography will help"></a>5. Typography will help</h3><p>A debate that long started at the advent of the internet and is still continuing is the effects of fonts on readability. Some recent <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/learn/serif-vs-sans-serif-fonts/" >studies from Canva have revealed that fonts have a lot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to do with readability. But most important of all, fonts have a huge effect on people’s emotions.</p><p>For instance, serif fonts have long been used in newspapers, magazines, and even web pages. That is why most users associate serif fonts with classical, nostalgic, and often professional or formal. And it is thus suitable when you are creating a professional podcast discussing business, education, and so on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-10.jpg"                      alt="podcast typography covers"                ></p><p>Sans serif is the new thing. It is all about throwing the tradition of using Serif fonts out of the window and using a fun and exciting and allowing users to read conveniently on the web-pages.</p><p>But typography does not mean it’s all about the font itself. The size of the font, the spaces in between the fonts, and the color of the font all play a differential role. So, ensure to learn about all the intricacies of typography and accordingly use fonts, their size, the gap in between them, their color, and so on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-11.jpg"                      alt="podcast typography blendcovers"                ></p><p>Additionally, you should focus on blending the typography with imagery. The combination of both often becomes messy and unreadable; of course, the creativity lies in</p><h3 id="6-Unique-and-high-resolution-images"><a href="#6-Unique-and-high-resolution-images" class="headerlink" title="6. Unique and high-resolution images"></a>6. Unique and high-resolution images</h3><p>A unique picture is what differentiates you from others. A user can easily locate and revisit your episodes if you use a unique-looking podcast cover. However, in addition to the unique design of the podcast cover, you should also ensure it is in high resolution.</p><p>Retain that a high-resolution picture speaks about class, professionalism, and sophistication, regardless of what you discuss in the podcast. At the same time, a low-resolution podcast is unsuitable and looks un-classy in the digital era.</p><h3 id="7-Brand-consistency"><a href="#7-Brand-consistency" class="headerlink" title="7. Brand consistency"></a>7. Brand consistency</h3><p>Of course, A&#x2F;B testing in the initial phases is necessary to test the design of the podcast cover. However, such tests are suitable for a short period of time. Ensure to spend enough time beforehand, so you do not have to change the design of the podcast cover often.</p><p>Brands like Coca-Cola, Nike, and Apple use consistency in their images and logos and ensure that all platforms have a similar brand image. This allows the users to recognize the brand, and the picture sits in the user’s mind. So, ensure consistency across all platforms and use the same cover images on all podcast directories.</p><h3 id="8-Image-compression"><a href="#8-Image-compression" class="headerlink" title="8. Image compression"></a>8. Image compression</h3><p>Almost all podcast directories will recommend you compress the podcast cover image, and for good reasons. Firstly, a small image loads faster on the pages and allows users to interact with your podcast at first sight. Second, mobile apps and web pages are very different in nature from web platforms. And a lot of users listen to the podcast via their smart phones, so it is best to use compressed images.</p><p>An ideal podcast cover art dimension is 3000 x 3000 pixels, which is a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Some podcast platforms, like Buzzsprout, do the image compression on their end. So, ensure not to compress the image beforehand, as this will further shrink the size of the image.</p><h3 id="9-Design-for-a-variety-of-sizes-and-re-purpose-your-art"><a href="#9-Design-for-a-variety-of-sizes-and-re-purpose-your-art" class="headerlink" title="9. Design for a variety of sizes and re-purpose your art"></a>9. Design for a variety of sizes and re-purpose your art</h3><p>When you design the podcast cover, it is best to take different aspect ratios and dimensions and sketch your plan. This will allow you to be more creative, and of course, you can easily resize the banner for respective podcast directories.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Make-an-Attractive-Podcast-Cover-Easily-with-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Make-an-Attractive-Podcast-Cover-Easily-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Make an Attractive Podcast Cover Easily with Filmora"></a>Bonus Tip: Make an Attractive Podcast Cover Easily with Filmora</h2><p>Now that you know how to choose color, font, typography, and content for the podcast cover art, let’s learn how to combine all these elements and design a podcast cover that is unique, different, and impressive.</p><p>However, using an effective tool like Filmora to design podcast covers is important.

For smooth and sharp gaming, it has a 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate. This results from an OLED panel that maintains amazing low input latency while delivering rich detail and unbeatable contrast without requiring special local dimming processing. Moreover, G-Sync or FreeSync Premium are supported as well as automatic low latency mode.</p><p>There may not be a huge difference between the LG C1 and the LG CX it replaces, but it has a new processor that can upscale 4K content and a new Game Optimizer that combines all the gaming features onto a single interface. In addition to virtualized 5.1.2-channel sound, Dolby Atmos support is included as well.</p><h4 id="2-Samsung-QN90A-QN95A"><a href="#2-Samsung-QN90A-QN95A" class="headerlink" title="2.

However, they need to understand it fully in order to know its potential to the fullest. Marketers need to understand how they can adapt as this world expands and different brands find opportunities to market and sell their products and services. In general, it is a platform suited to market to the Millenials as well as the Gen Zers. These generations are the most avid users of Metaverses. That is mainly pertaining to virtual gaming zones and technologies such as AR and VR.</p><p>Here we explore what <strong>Metaverse marketing</strong> is and what the concept means for brands as well.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Does-Metaverse-Mean-for-Brands"><a href="#Part-3-What-Does-Metaverse-Mean-for-Brands" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Does Metaverse Mean for Brands?"></a>Part 3: What Does Metaverse Mean for Brands?</h2><p>Metaverse is considered as a successor to what the present-day internet offers. Today mobile internet has predominance. This is a different era compared to broadband internet that came by in the nineties as well as in the early part of the new millennium.</p><p>Today there is the convergence of artificial intelligence, cloud processing as well as 5G technologies. These have been attributed to offering a cost-effective and enjoyable VR and AR experience. This is also due to increased connectivity that now exists across different devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-brand-marketing.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Brand Marketing"                ></p><p>Source: venturebeat.com</p><p>Today, the way we consume data and brands has shifted. Metaverse represents a confluence of several things, from social interactions to gaming or even the cryptocurrency universe. Metaverse attempts to blur the lines to create a reality that is used and perceived differently by different people. It sets up a democratised and decentralized space.</p><p>Brands need to remember that Metaverse puts people before. Hence, it provides them an opportunity to present their offerings in a different light or perspective. Metaverse is spaces that are characterized by playfulness, community and creation of values. Brands can embed their services and products in a creative manner in such an environment. It also gives exposure to unexplored audiences without having to worry about real-world outcomes in such an environment.</p><p>One of the pioneers to embrace this concept is Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is CEO of Facebook and he believes that it is the future path forward for his company. His enterprise is about a trillion dollars worth. He believes that it will help expand his social media platforms where people will engage more. It will combine platforms for work, play as well as a platform to socialize at. Indeed, after they changed their name to Meta, the word has been trending across internet portals. It is yet to be seen how Facebook makes the transition to Meta a successful one. This is especially because Facebook is still sorting out some PR legalities. However, Metaverse influencer marketing is another huge gain for this company.</p><p><strong>Learned from Metaverse Marketing Examples</strong></p><p>Here are some examples of Metaverse marketing brands that are embracing the concept of a Metaverse in marketing:</p><h3 id="1-NASCAR"><a href="#1-NASCAR" class="headerlink" title="1. NASCAR"></a>1. NASCAR</h3><p>NASCAR has recently formed a multi-year program to increase awareness of its brand in the eyes of gamers, especially those of the young generation. This is specially planned for the Roblox product of NASCAR. The company has formed a digital car that is part of the Jailbreak video game. It is also selling apparel in Jailbreak that players can purchase, as per their avatars. There is also a fan contest planned in which players will be able to design their own uniforms. The company is collaborating with its developers to act as influencers. They are promoting the game and oncoming launches through different social media platforms.</p><h3 id="2-GrandTheft-Auto-V"><a href="#2-GrandTheft-Auto-V" class="headerlink" title="2.GrandTheft Auto V"></a>2.GrandTheft Auto V</h3><p>Grand Theft Auto V is a sandbox game of the open world. It released different clothing options which were similar to what Hong Kong protestors wore. These protesters were able to take their fight to the Metaverse. Many artists also joined in who helped showcase their political expressions. In this way, the game increased its marketing as well as helped another segment to promote its cause.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-marketing-grand-theft.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Marketing Grand Theft"                ></p><p>Source: nascar.com</p><h3 id="3-Houzz"><a href="#3-Houzz" class="headerlink" title="3. Houzz"></a>3. Houzz</h3><p>Among Metaverse marketing examples,Houzz is another brand that is able to use Metaverse marketing in a big way. It allows interested customers to create photos of the kind of home items or furniture they want. Whenever anyone purchases items that they digitally create and find Houzz earns money. They even have a 3D viewer application. This allows users to view items in three-dimensional ways and they can then opt to have the same in their physical space.</p><h3 id="4-Dimension-Studio"><a href="#4-Dimension-Studio" class="headerlink" title="4. Dimension Studio"></a>4. Dimension Studio</h3><p>Dimension Studio is another brand that has experimented with Metaverse successfully. They have been able to raise as much as $6.5 million as a result of promoting fashion brands using this platform. They have created a virtual setup that allows users to be scanned by 100 different cameras and dropped into different virtual forums. They can then test out different garments. The brand Balenciaga had launched a game called Afterworld, designed to showcase their collections for the autumn and winter season of 2021. The Metaverse technology of Dimension Studio came of much use then.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Future-of-the-Metaverse-Opportunities-or-Challenges"><a href="#Part-4-Future-of-the-Metaverse-Opportunities-or-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Future of the Metaverse: Opportunities or Challenges?"></a>Part 4: Future of the Metaverse: Opportunities or Challenges?</h2><h3 id="1-Opportunities-That-it-Presents"><a href="#1-Opportunities-That-it-Presents" class="headerlink" title="1. Opportunities That it Presents"></a>1. Opportunities That it Presents</h3><p>Many brands have joined the bandwagon by building virtual worlds. Many are selling NFTs or non-fungible tokens. These are designed based on blockchain methodology. This allows people to own unique digital items such as videos or images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-future.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Future"                ></p><p>Source: xrtoday.com</p><p>Many brands are also showcasing digital advertising on Metaverse platforms. Ads are being placed by different brands in games which are billboards or in the form of branded clothing. These are in-game ads, as they would appear in the real world. These ad slots are sold as CPMs that cost between $6 to $12 across different platforms.</p><p>Another advantage is how Metaverse marketing strategies can open up opportunities in the world of education. Active participation in class can be increased through this new technology. Today much work is being done to incorporate immersive technology such as virtual reality in such spaces. Also, 3D environments are also being brought into the fold in this segment.</p><h3 id="2-Limitations"><a href="#2-Limitations" class="headerlink" title="2. Limitations"></a>2. Limitations</h3><p>Metaverse is at a nascent stage as yet. Hence, marketers are still learning how best to exploit the opportunities it presents, especially from the monetization standpoint. Brands that are not that much in the digital world need to update their asset libraries.</p><p>The other issue is about how to determine the return on investment. Creating comprehensive digital assets can be time-consuming and costly. Also, marketers need to track returns that they get on their ad spending. This needs to be as clear as on other digital channels.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Marketing in the Metaverse is the next trending thing in the world of digital marketing. As this platform gains center stage in the upcoming years, it opens up opportunities for different brands to exploit. However, Metaverse digital marketing would prove to be more relevant to some brands than to others.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Marketing?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What Is Metaverse Marketing?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">What Does Metaverse Mean for Brands?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Future of the Metaverse: Opportunities or Challenges?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Marketing-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Marketing?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Marketing?</h2><p>Metaverse is a concept that is relatively new in the virtual world.

Therefore, other apps should not be used during recording because they can use computer bandwidth and cause video quality to decline. In addition, most Mac users have complained that the Photo Booth application freezes and crashes while recording a video or that it has a freezing&#x2F;lagging issue.</p><p>The program frequently freezes, even shortly after you start recording, indicating that it is not a problem caused by the video’s duration or size. Press the stop button to see the notorious “spinning wheel of death” or a Beach Ball symbol when you finish recording. As many users have experienced, you may encounter the following issues with Photo Booth.</p><ul><li>While capturing videos, Photo Booth freezes every 30 seconds.</li><li>The video recording in the Photo Booth is sluggish.</li><li>After capturing a picture, the Photo Booth freezes, and no picture appears.</li><li>The video and audio in the Photo Booth recording are out of sync.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-fix-the-photo-booth-video-to-keep-freezing"><a href="#How-to-fix-the-photo-booth-video-to-keep-freezing" class="headerlink" title="How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?"></a>How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?</h2><p>Here are some ways you can try to fix the photo booth from freezing:</p><ul><li>If you’re recording while using many apps other than the Photo Booth software, your Mac’s processor may be nearing its maximum. After you’ve closed all other programs, try recording.</li><li>Before recording a video, restart your Mac to ensure that you are not being interrupted by numerous user accounts or the apps&#x2F;widgets they are using.</li><li>Check to determine if your computer’s startup disc has adequate free space. To check available free space on your Mac, go to the Finder &gt; File &gt; Get Info menu command. You can free up disc space by moving files to another drive and deleting files from the startup disc that you no longer require.</li><li>After moving the photos and videos from the Photo Booth application to a different directory, restart the software.</li><li>Select Get Info and check the option Open in 32-bit mode by right-clicking or Control + clicking on Photo Booth in the programs folder.</li><li>Your system software could also be the source of these symptoms.</li><li>Update the system software to the most recent version.</li><li>NVRAM &#x2F; PRAM should be reset.</li><li>To see if you have read and written permissions on Photo Booth in the programs folder, right-click or Control + Click on it and pick Get Info. Give yourself permission to read and write if you haven’t before.</li><li>If your Photo Booth still stalls and crashes after trying all of the above methods, reinstall OS X.</li><li>When you record a video with the camera, be sure it works in iMovie (from the camera icon somewhere down the left-hand side). If the problem persists in iMovie, it indicates a problem with the camera hardware, necessitating the return of the Mac to Apple.</li><li>If iMovie works fine, try removing the Photo Booth preferences: &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Preferences&#x2F;com.apple. In addition, PhotoBooth.plist should be deleted.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer"><a href="#Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?"></a>Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is the greatest <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, without a doubt, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p><p>You’ll discover some professional tools to help you improve video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort with the Filmora video editor. This tool is one of the most dependable, aside from the features that allow you to modify video rotation easily.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the video file</strong></p><p>To access the primary editing interface, open Wondershare Filmora and select “New Project.” Then select “Import” to load files from your computer. You can also connect your devices by dragging and dropping files into the software or using the Import option. Filmora can handle images, video, and audio files with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-1.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Organize the media</strong></p><p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the files you import into the editor. However, when searching for the video clips, you want to add to the timeline, working with many different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. To reduce clutter and confusion, use the My Album feature, which allows you to create folders and organize your files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-2.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>To create and name a new folder, click the Add a New Folder icon in the top right corner of the editor’s screen, situated at the bottom of the My Project page. You can sort the footage alphabetically or any other way that improves your efficiency and reduces the time you spend looking through files.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Effects</strong></p><p>You may now disconnect the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or utilize one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-3.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>If you want to add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to a video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software comes with various text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the template you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-4.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>Next to the Text&#x2F;Credit symbol, you’ll find the Transitions icon in the editor’s toolbar, which gives you access to hundreds of settings.

You can quickly select the video file format in the Format menu in the Output window and optimize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.</p><p>Select the file type that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format tab, gives the video a title, and choose the folder on your hard drive where the video will be exported.

To reduce clutter and confusion, use the My Album feature, which allows you to create folders and organize your files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-2.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>To create and name a new folder, click the Add a New Folder icon in the top right corner of the editor’s screen, situated at the bottom of the My Project page. You can sort the footage alphabetically or any other way that improves your efficiency and reduces the time you spend looking through files.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Effects</strong></p><p>You may now disconnect the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or utilize one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-3.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>If you want to add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to a video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software comes with various text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the template you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-4.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>Next to the Text&#x2F;Credit symbol, you’ll find the Transitions icon in the editor’s toolbar, which gives you access to hundreds of settings. Learn more about video transitions and how to apply them in Filmora by watching this video tutorial.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Export and Share</strong></p><p>When you’re certain there’s nothing else you want to change or add to your project, click the Export button. You can quickly select the video file format in the Format menu in the Output window and optimize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.</p><p>Select the file type that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format tab, gives the video a title, and choose the folder on your hard drive where the video will be exported. Next, you can select the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-5.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?</p><p>Here are some ways you can try to fix the photo booth from freezing:</p><ul><li>If you’re recording while using many apps other than the Photo Booth software, your Mac’s processor may be nearing its maximum. After you’ve closed all other programs, try recording.</li><li>Before recording a video, restart your Mac to ensure that you are not being interrupted by numerous user accounts or the apps&#x2F;widgets they are using.</li><li>Check to determine if your computer’s startup disc has adequate free space. To check available free space on your Mac, go to the Finder &gt; File &gt; Get Info menu command. You can free up disc space by moving files to another drive and deleting files from the startup disc that you no longer require.</li><li>After moving the photos and videos from the Photo Booth application to a different directory, restart the software.</li><li>Select Get Info and check the option Open in 32-bit mode by right-clicking or Control + clicking on Photo Booth in the programs folder.</li><li>Your system software could also be the source of these symptoms.</li><li>Update the system software to the most recent version.</li><li>NVRAM &#x2F; PRAM should be reset.</li><li>To see if you have read and written permissions on Photo Booth in the programs folder, right-click or Control + Click on it and pick Get Info. Give yourself permission to read and write if you haven’t before.</li><li>If your Photo Booth still stalls and crashes after trying all of the above methods, reinstall OS X.</li><li>When you record a video with the camera, be sure it works in iMovie (from the camera icon somewhere down the left-hand side). If the problem persists in iMovie, it indicates a problem with the camera hardware, necessitating the return of the Mac to Apple.</li><li>If iMovie works fine, try removing the Photo Booth preferences: &#x2F;Library&#x2F;Preferences&#x2F;com.apple. In addition, PhotoBooth.plist should be deleted.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer-3"><a href="#Bonus-tip-How-to-edit-a-video-on-a-computer-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?"></a>Bonus tip: How to edit a video on a computer?</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is the greatest <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, without a doubt, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p><p>You’ll discover some professional tools to help you improve video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort with the Filmora video editor.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Navigating-the-Nuances-of-Snapchat-High-Visibility"><a href="#Navigating-the-Nuances-of-Snapchat-High-Visibility" class="headerlink" title="Navigating the Nuances of Snapchat High-Visibility"></a>Navigating the Nuances of Snapchat High-Visibility</h2><p>Snapchat is one of the most popular instant messaging apps. The key feature that makes it different from other messaging apps is that users can send text messages, pictures, and short videos that disappear after they are viewed.</p><p>Over the years, Snapchat has introduced various features that elevated its status from being an instant messaging app to a social media platform. In November 2020, Snapchat rolled out a new feature called Spotlight that has become a massive hit among users.</p><p>The Spotlight feature aims to make Snapchat compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. As you may have guessed now, Spotlight is a collection of the most entertaining videos posted by app users.</p><p>Whether you want to post your videos on Snapchat Spotlight or want to know more about them, you just need to go through this article.</p><h2 id="What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat introduced Spotlight as a whole new section in its app that features several engaging short videos, also known as Snaps. The maximum duration of a video can be up to 1 minute or 60 seconds. Content creators must submit their videos to Spotlight so that moderators can review them and decide if they are worthy of featuring in the Spotlight section.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the intention of adding the Spotlight feature in Snapchat is to engage users through short-form user videos, just like TikTok. After the massive popularity gained by TikTok in 2020, many platforms tried following the same path to glory, including Snapchat and Instagram.</p><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences"></a>Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences</h3><p>When comparing Snapchat and TikTok, there are specific differences that you can quickly notice. Let’s discuss those differences below:</p><p><strong>● Comments Sections</strong></p><p>While watching short-form videos on TikTok, you can leave your thoughts in the comments. However, you get no such comments section in the Snapchat Spotlight.</p><p><strong>● Privacy Protection</strong></p><p>If we talk about TikTok, you can view the display name of the content creator for each video. On the other hand, Snapchat enforces a strict privacy protection mechanism that hides the display name of creators if they are under 18. However, there’s an option to use a public profile if users below 18 wish to make their display name available to viewers.</p><h3 id="Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight"></a>Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight</h3><p>It’s easy to submit snaps (short-form videos) on Snapchat Spotlight. However, it is essential to ensure that your videos adhere to specific guidelines set by Snapchat. This section aims to make you familiar with them.</p><p><strong>Video Requirements</strong></p><p>The snaps that you want to submit to Spotlight should meet the following technical requirements:</p><ul><li>The minimum duration of a snap is 5 seconds, while the maximum is 60 seconds.</li><li>The video should be in portrait orientation.</li><li>The minimum aspect ratio of a snap is 3:4.</li><li>The horizontal resolution of a snap must be at least 640 px.</li><li>There shouldn’t be any logo in the snap.</li><li>The content of the snap should cover the complete frame.</li></ul><p>If your snap doesn’t meet the above-mentioned requirements, it will become ineligible for getting featured on Spotlight.</p><p><strong>Submission Terms</strong></p><p>There are certain community guidelines that apply to all Spotlight snaps. These guidelines ensure that the snaps within Spotlight entertain people without hurting their sentiments in any way.</p><p>While posting a snap on Spotlight, you need to avoid content that contains the following:</p><ul><li>Sexual acts</li><li>Harassment and bullying</li><li>Threats, violence, or harm</li><li>Illegal activities</li><li>Terrorism and hate speech</li></ul><p>You can go through the official <a class="link"   href="https://snap.com/en-US/community-guidelines" >Snapchat community guidelines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learn more.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat Spotlight is relatively easy to use, especially if you are familiar with YouTube Shorts and TikTok. If you want to submit snaps to Spotlight, you will be happy to know that the whole process is quick and straightforward. The only thing that will consume a significant time is the snap creation itself.</p><p>If you already have a video or a snap idea that can make it to Spotlight, you need to know the steps for submitting a snap to Spotlight. We will discuss them in the next section.</p><h3 id="How-to-Post-on-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Post-on-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Post on Spotlight?"></a>How to Post on Spotlight?</h3><p>There are multiple methods to submit a snap to Spotlight. For example, you can create a new snap using the phone’s camera or advance an existing video from your gallery. Also, Snapchat lets you submit a snap to Spotlight from a desktop using a web browser.</p><p>Let’s discuss each method one by one below.</p><p><strong>From Phone</strong></p><p>Step1 Launch the Snapchat app on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-post-on-spotlight-from-phone-1.jpg"                      alt="open snapchat"                ></p><p>Step2 You can toggle between the front-facing and rear-facing cameras by tapping the camera toggle button or double-clicking on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-post-on-spotlight-from-phone-2.jpg"                      alt="take a snap"                ></p><p>Step3 There are other options on the screen as well, such as flash on&#x2F;off, add music, and more. You can customize your snap with them.</p><p>Step4 You need to press and hold the camera button to start recording a video.

Then, here comes another important question: How to become a successful Snapchat creator?</p><p>Similar to TikTok and YouTube Shorts, there’s massive competition among creators on Snapchat. Both existing and new creators submit numerous snaps daily to get featured on Spotlight. So, how come you improve your chances of making it to Spotlight?</p><p>Well, the first thing you need to know is the algorithm that Snapchat Spotlight utilizes to show snaps to users. Secondly, there are some tips to help you build your Snapchat community. We’ll discuss both of them in the following sections.</p><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-Algorithm-A-Brief-Overview"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-Algorithm-A-Brief-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight Algorithm: A Brief Overview"></a>Snapchat Spotlight Algorithm: A Brief Overview</h3><p>Snapchat makes use of a specialized algorithm for Spotlight. The algorithm decides what snaps to show to a particular user based on their interests and other factors.</p><p>The following are the key factors that the Spotlight algorithm considers for showing users the most relevant and exciting snaps.</p><p><strong>Unique Views</strong></p><p>A unique view means a user viewed a snap at least once in a single session. If a user views a snap multiple times in a single session, it will still be considered a unique view.</p><p><strong>Total View Time</strong></p><p>It represents the total time that users have spent watching a snap. If a user watches a single snap multiple times, the duration of each individual view will be added to the total view time.</p><p><strong>Number of Times the Video was Shared</strong></p><p>It represents the total number of times Snapchat users shared a particular snap with others.</p><p><strong>Number of Screenshots</strong></p><p>This factor considers the total number of times a screenshot was taken of a snap by a user.</p><h3 id="Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community"><a href="#Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community" class="headerlink" title="Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community"></a>Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community</h3><p>Your Snapchat community is your audience who loves to watch and interact with your snaps. Building a Snapchat community means growing your audience by delivering genuine, entertaining, and engaging content.</p><p>Here are some tips that can help you build a Snapchat community.</p><p><strong>Choose a Niche</strong></p><p>Uploading random snaps will not earn you a loyal audience on Spotlight. So, you need to pick a specific niche, such as gaming, pranks, and comedy, to target a particular audience with your snaps.</p><p><strong>Use Snapchat’s Built-in Creative Tools</strong></p><p>Snapchat provides several tools to help you become more creative with your snaps. Using those creative tools is good as the Spotlight algorithm pretends to prioritize videos edited with Snapchat’s native tools.</p><p><strong>Stay Consistent</strong></p><p>It is challenging to post snaps consistently, especially if you are just starting. However, maintaining consistency with your Snaps will help you earn more audience.</p><h2 id="A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey"><a href="#A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey" class="headerlink" title="A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey"></a>A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey</h2><p>Hopefully, you have known how to use Snapchat Spotlight and been ready to plan your creator life.
