    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="What-Are-LUTs-and-How-They-Change-Your-Photography"><a href="#What-Are-LUTs-and-How-They-Change-Your-Photography" class="headerlink" title="What Are LUTs and How They Change Your Photography"></a>What Are LUTs and How They Change Your Photography</h2><p>LUTs are popular in the photographic field for all the appropriate purposes. Photographers are now seriously considering the post-processing step of photography, as editing has gained significance. While editing used to be a time-consuming and arduous operation, it has become much easier with the advent of tools like LUTs.</p><p>A LUT is a conversion profile that takes your original photograph’s color values, converts them to predefined values, and then adds the new color values. Because the method is similar, some people mix it with color correcting. However, LUTs do the opposite of fixing the colors in your picture. LUTs alter the colors of a photograph to match a specific color scheme.</p><p>To put it another way, it’s a color preset for your photo that you can apply with a single click. These speeds up color grading by eliminating the need to modify color wheels and other color selections.</p><p>LUTs are classified according to their intended use. Some LUTs make flat-looking Log photos look rich and contrasty. Some LUTs change the look of a picture from one preset to another. Other LUTs convert images between other color spaces.</p><p>LUT stands for Lookup Table, and it’s a word you’ll hear a lot in the photographic business. A picture file or a Photoshop plug-in can both be referred to by the abbreviation LUT. Photographers who wish to add specific colors or tones to their shots employ Photoshop plugins, which are generally used in video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro and Davinci Resolve.</p><p>While this may appear to be a complicated idea in the editing process, trust us when we say it isn’t. Color-coded arithmetic equations called LUTs can be used to change the color of your photos or video footage. This program is the most efficient way to alter images without sacrificing quality. LUTs are something you really need for various reasons. Color correcting and replication software are included in your camera. Despite this, you will observe that the output graphics are not up to par when recording in LOG. You might even start to doubt if your capturing methods are incorrect with this shabby-looking imagery wrapped with a satin gloss all around.</p><p>However, this is not the case. These photographs and films are exquisite; all they want is some post-processing enhancements, which is where LUTs come in.</p><p>It’s not dissimilar to a monitor calibration profile, which corrects the colors displayed on a monitor, or a printer profile, which produces exact colors in a printed photo. However, this discussion process is being utilized to alter tones and colors for an artistic rather than remedial effect, which is a crucial distinction to grasp. LUTs are well-established in the worlds of video editing and cinematography, but their immediate impact and ease of usage also appeal to still photographers.</p><p>Lookup Tables help you save a lot of work and time during the editing process. This tool allows you to create a preset look for a particular visual impact. It also accelerates the color grading process. You save a lot of time editing because you may use it immediately for your photographs and movies. LUTs also provide you the artistic opportunity to develop your own personal editing style.</p><p>LUTs also aid in the organization of your post-production processes. You must know when to use LUTs, just as you must know when to use other components of the editing process. It assists in getting the work done more effectively after you master the pattern and processes to follow.</p><h2 id="How-will-LUTs-change-your-photography"><a href="#How-will-LUTs-change-your-photography" class="headerlink" title="How will LUTs change your photography?"></a>How will LUTs change your photography?</h2><p>Photo editors who are searching for that extra oomph to take their images to the next level adore LUTs. Photographers who wish to save time without losing the excellent quality and aesthetic outcomes that come with hours of minor, manual slider tweaks will benefit significantly from LUTs. You can give your photos a professional look they deserve with just one click. Using the same LUT or a modest selection of LUTs across the board can also help you create consistency throughout a particular photo set or an entire portfolio.</p><p>Put another way; a LUT is similar to applying a filter to your image. LUTs are frequently applied via a filter layer in Photoshop, and this is actually the case. A photographer may utilize a LUT for photo enhancement for various reasons.</p><p>LUTs assist you in applying a fresh color look to Raw or Jpg photos in seconds. Without adjusting any of your editing program’s sliders, a LUT is set on its own. So you may tweak all of your sliders as much as you want to personalize them. Most programs allow you to adjust the amount of LUT to be used and the overlay settings. Luts enables you to make color adjustments that are difficult or impossible to do in most photo editing software. The tone range of your image can be altered by using a LUT. More appealing skin tones, Faces should not appear tanned—custom color palettes for dramatic portraits, landscapes, and other images.</p><p>Warm or cold tones and bold or washed-out styles are all options provided by the LUTs.</p><p>Photographers may now utilize the same techniques that film, and television editors have used for years to achieve the excellent new aesthetics seen in blockbusters. With quick LUT looks, you can now apply LUTs to your photographs to make your editing work stand out.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-LUTs-using-Photoshop-CC"><a href="#How-to-use-LUTs-using-Photoshop-CC" class="headerlink" title="How to use LUTs using Photoshop CC?"></a>How to use LUTs using Photoshop CC?</h2><p>LUTs come pre-installed with programs, but you may also purchase them online and add them to your software. You may even buy a look from your favorite film or television show. In Photoshop, LUTs are simple to apply. You can begin in Photoshop with the original photo, which is an image that was captured locally, unprocessed, and straight out of the camera.</p><ol><li>Select the Adjustment Layer icon from the drop-down menu.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/luts-photography-1.jpg"                      alt="how to use luts using Photoshop cc"                ></p><p>Choose Adjustment Layer</p><ol><li>Opt for Color Lookup.</li><li>The Properties inspector will appear.

As mentioned earlier, they’ll alter the image’s colors, and some of them will also alter the contrast. But what if you want to add LUTs? To add LUTs to Photoshop, you have two options. The first is really simple; all you have to do is discover the LUT and apply it to that specific project. The alternative is a little more difficult, but it enables you to access your LUTs at all times.</p><h3 id="Here’s-the-first-method"><a href="#Here’s-the-first-method" class="headerlink" title="Here’s the first method"></a>Here’s the first method</h3><ol><li>It would be best to unzip the LUT before using it in your project. This is relatively simple, and you may either use specialized software or the built-in unzipping utility in Windows.</li><li>When discussing Photoshop, the project is typically an image, so go ahead and open it. Open a new one by pressing ‘Ctrl+O’ or importing something from your cloud.</li><li>To do so, go to the ‘Adjustments’ tab and select the ‘Color Lookup’ button.</li><li>Select the ‘Load 3D LUT’ button, then navigate to the directory where you unpacked the LUT files.</li></ol><h3 id="Here’s-the-second-one"><a href="#Here’s-the-second-one" class="headerlink" title="Here’s the second one"></a>Here’s the second one</h3><ol><li>Open the LUT folder, which changes the version to your version.</li><li>Simply copy your LUTs into the appropriate folder. Make sure Photoshop is closed, and your project is saved before you begin. Otherwise, it may crash, and you will lose all of your work.</li><li>When you’re finished, open Photoshop and use the “Color Lookup” settings to find your LUTs.</li></ol><p>Now that you know how to use LUTs in Photoshop, you’ll have a lot of fun creating your own look!</p><p><strong>Wondershare Filmora11</strong> Express Better<br>Achieve More<br>Grow Together</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a href="#">Learn More</a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/box-filmora-x.png"                      alt="Filmora Windows"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-9-square.svg"                      alt="Filmora Mac"                ></p><p>Closing Thoughts:</p><p>LUTs are extremely useful since they allow photographers to save time by using the same LUTs or a set of LUTs for several photographs.

What’s a Good Podcast Interview Question?"></a>Part 2. What’s a Good Podcast Interview Question?</h2><p>After discussing the 50 questions you can ask in a podcast, let’s see what a good podcast interview question is. A good interview question is comfortable for the guest and engaging for the listeners, so the guest can answer the question wholeheartedly. Therefore, you need to avoid impolite and aggressive asks during podcasting. Besides, try to ask such questions that your guest is not frequently asked. It may reveal new things about him and make your podcast stand out.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-on-How-To-Come-Up-and-Ask-Better-Questions"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-on-How-To-Come-Up-and-Ask-Better-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Tips on How To Come Up and Ask Better Questions"></a>Part 3. Tips on How To Come Up and Ask Better Questions</h2><p>Asking better questions on a podcast requires preparation beforehand. Here are some tips for you to come up with better questions:</p><ol><li>Write down your objectives for the interview.</li><li>Write down any questions about the guest or what they do that comes to your mind immediately.</li><li>Create a list of everything the guest does (or is interested in) in addition to their primary occupation.</li><li>Create a list of questions you would like to ask and learn from the speaker.</li></ol><p>You can get the best information from the person you are interviewing if you do the following:</p><h3 id="Ask-WHY"><a href="#Ask-WHY" class="headerlink" title="Ask WHY?"></a>Ask WHY?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcast-interview-questions-5.jpg"                      alt="ask why"                ></p><p>As an interviewer, “why” is your most powerful tool. Guests usually provide surface-level information or opinions. The follow-up question of “why” makes them go further and give deeper details. It will also help your audience understand correctly what the guest wants to say.</p><h3 id="What-happened-next"><a href="#What-happened-next" class="headerlink" title="What happened next?"></a>What happened next?</h3><p>If your guest is overwhelmed by the emotions and has stopped before completing his answer, help him achieve it by asking, “What Happened Next?” Use a softer tone while asking this question.</p><h3 id="What-were-your-feelings-when-this-happened"><a href="#What-were-your-feelings-when-this-happened" class="headerlink" title="What were your feelings when this happened?"></a>What were your feelings when this happened?</h3><p>Sometimes you want the guest to answer your questions with feelings and emotions. Making your guest answer your questions while drenched in emotions can take your podcast to the next level. Questions like “What were your feelings when this happened?” can take the guest back to the past and make him answer your question with full emotions.</p><h3 id="Mirror-your-guest"><a href="#Mirror-your-guest" class="headerlink" title="Mirror your guest"></a>Mirror your guest</h3><p>Repeat the same few last words that a guest just said when he finishes his thought, and by doing that, you’re creating an intonation that’s sort of like a question. It’s another way to permit the person you’re interviewing to keep going. For example, your question might go like this. Perhaps you’re asking somebody about his favorite software of the year that they’ve used in video editing.</p><p>He might answer like this “one of my favorite software is called <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a using-friendly video editing software that you can use even to do podcast shows and impressive vlogs. And I love it because I have been editing YouTube videos daily.”</p><ul><li>You: “You’ve been going to edit every day?”</li><li>The Guest: “Yeah, I’ve been editing videos for YouTube for over 200 days. And it’s been really neat to connect with audiences there.”</li><li>You: “Connect with the audience? How?”</li><li>The Guest: “Well, you know it’s posting videos, so there’s intimate interaction with people who seem to be there and watch the videos I post. And I’ve gotten to know many of them by name now.”</li></ul><p>So you see how this can continue to move forward by simply mirroring your guest. Try it in your following conversation, even if it’s not an interview.</p><h4 id="Tell-me-about-a-time-when…"><a href="#Tell-me-about-a-time-when…" class="headerlink" title="Tell me about a time when…"></a>Tell me about a time when…</h4><p>The best thing you can extract from someone in a podcast is their story. If you want to pull out a story from someone, phrase it like this, “Tell me about a time when…” After this question, your job is to sit back, listen, and not interrupt the guest.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Podcast-Questions-to-Avoid-Asking"><a href="#Part-4-Podcast-Questions-to-Avoid-Asking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Podcast Questions to Avoid Asking"></a>Part 4. Podcast Questions to Avoid Asking</h2><p>Avoiding asking wrong questions is as important as asking good questions. Some questions will negatively impact your podcast’s quality, so avoid asking such questions. Here are some questions that you should not ask.</p><ul><li>Avoid asking questions that your guest is frequently asked. For example, if he appears on numerous interview podcasts and shows, he is likely often asked the same question.</li><li>Avoid asking basic questions like, “What are you best known for?”</li><li>Questions you anticipate will result in a “yes” should be avoided, as a simple “yes” adds little value to the interview for those listening.</li><li>Similarly, avoid asking questions to which you can predict the answer will be a “no.”</li><li>Avoid questions that might offend your guest.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-5-Should-I-Send-an-Advance-Interview-Questions-Podcast"><a href="#Part-5-Should-I-Send-an-Advance-Interview-Questions-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Should I Send an Advance Interview Questions Podcast?"></a>Part 5. Should I Send an Advance Interview Questions Podcast?</h2><p>Yes, you can send interview questions to guests. Therefore, they get time to prepare interesting responses. Also, they may think about their answers or type out lengthy responses. Either way, they’ll feel more comfortable and help you make better content.</p><h2 id="Take-Your-Content-to-the-Next-Level-and-Gets-Shared"><a href="#Take-Your-Content-to-the-Next-Level-and-Gets-Shared" class="headerlink" title="Take Your Content to the Next Level and Gets Shared"></a>Take Your Content to the Next Level and Gets Shared</h2><p>A podcast is only as good as the questions being asked. By carefully choosing which questions to ask and which to avoid, you can take your content to the next level. It also enhances the interest of listeners.</p><p>Consider the following when picking which of the above questions to use on your show: will it let your guest reveal something about who they are, how they think, or what they know will benefit your audience? If so, you are most likely on the right path! Make your podcast worth listening to get more views and shares.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular

According to most users, the built-in image viewer is not top of the list. As you keep reading, you will discover why Windows 10 Photos is not a good choice. In addition, you will find recommendations for fast image viewer Windows 10 and why they outrank the proprietary software. Finally, remember that the list contains free and paid programs you can use for your creative work.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">PhotoDirector 365</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">XnView Classic</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">IrfanView Graphic Viewer</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">WidsMob Viewer Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Image Glass</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Best Free Video Editor to Make Slideshow with Photos</a></li><li><a href="#part4">FAQs</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice"><a href="#Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice" class="headerlink" title="Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?"></a>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow"><a href="#1-It-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="4. Horrible user experience"></a><strong>4. Horrible user experience</strong></h4><p>How quickly can you save a file to the cloud? Most programs take seconds. Unfortunately, using image viewer Windows 10 is a completely different ball game.?</p><p>First, you have to save a copy of your photo. Then, find the duplicate and then upload it to One Drive. What a nightmare!</p><h2 id="Part2-Top-Best-Fast-Photo-Viewer-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Part2-Top-Best-Fast-Photo-Viewer-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Top Best Fast Photo Viewer for Windows 10"></a>Part2: Top Best Fast Photo Viewer for Windows 10</h2><p>There are several more reasons why you should not use photo viewer for Windows 10.

How can you switch from photo viewer for Windows 10 to your preferred software?</h4><p>Access the <strong>Default Apps</strong> menu from the <strong>Settings</strong> option of your OS. Then, change your preferred app by selecting it from the <strong>Photos</strong> menu.</p><p>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</p><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow-1"><a href="#1-It-is-slow-1" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore-1"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience-1"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

The short answer is pretty well: the accompanying app and software are intuitive and powerful, the video quality is good, and the overall user experience is great. But, for many people, this little device isn’t the best option, or even an option. For one thing, the round shape is a little awkward, and doesn’t fit conveniently in a pocket to carry it around. More importantly, the Gear 360 is only supported on Samsung phones. Yes, that’s right, unless you have a pretty recent Samsung phone, you’re out of luck on this one. Other concerns from users include the poor microphone quality, and the visible stitch lines in the picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/samsung-gear-360-camera.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Gear 360"                ></p><p> If the Gear 360 isn’t the right choice for your 360-degree camera needs, just what is? Luckily, there are lots of other models out there. Let’s look at five of the best.</p><h2 id="Top-5-Samsung-Gear-360-Camera-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Top-5-Samsung-Gear-360-Camera-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Samsung Gear 360 Camera Alternatives"></a>Top 5 Samsung Gear 360 Camera Alternatives</h2><h3 id="1-360fly"><a href="#1-360fly" class="headerlink" title="1. 360fly"></a>1. 360fly</h3><p> Let’s start with the 360fly. This model is tough, being waterproof, dustproof, and shock proof. This makes it a great choice for use outdoors, and when travelling. It can be controlled using an iOS app, or with the included Bluetooth remote. It is also able to live stream footage, so that you can see it as you shoot. However, the video quality is not the best, and there can be some aberrations in color at the edges of the shot. Another issue that some users complain about is the that it offers only 32 GB of internal storage, with no way to extend it. It retails around $500, and is solid, but not outstanding, camera.</p><p> Check this video to watch the 360fly 4k unboxing review:</p><h3 id="2-Nikon-Key-Mission-360"><a href="#2-Nikon-Key-Mission-360" class="headerlink" title="2. Nikon Key Mission 360"></a>2. Nikon Key Mission 360</h3><p> Due to be released in the fall, Nikon’s Key Mission 360 will be a contender at a similar price point to the 360fly; it’s expected to retail for $499. This pocket sized device is meant to be rugged. It’s dustproof, shockproof, and waterproof to 100 ft. This camera will have two lenses to supply the 360-degree image and be used through a related app with a simple interface. Expectations are high for this offering, and it just might be worth waiting for if you need a camera that can take whatever you throw at it.</p><p> See more details about Nikon Key Mission 360 camera from this video:</p><h3 id="3-Bublcam"><a href="#3-Bublcam" class="headerlink" title="3. Bublcam"></a>3. Bublcam</h3><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bublcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses 4 lenses to ensure a 360-degree view in every direction, with no blind spots. Retailing around $800, it’s one of the more expensive consumer grade VR cameras, but makes up for it by offering 1080p video and high quality photos. The spherical camera has some motion-activated stabilization, meant to keep shaky camera work from ruining your perfect shots. It has a microSD card slot, allowing you to add storage. Unfortunately, the microphone quality is not great, but if you’re relatively close to the camera, it should be pretty clear. Unlike the 360fly, the Bublcam is pretty small, fitting comfortably into the palm of your hand, or a jacket pocket. The camera also ships with a small tripod, which is extremely handy for taking good shots.</p><p> Bublcam’s unboxing review:</p><h3 id="4-Ricoh-Theta-S"><a href="#4-Ricoh-Theta-S" class="headerlink" title="4. Ricoh Theta S"></a>4. Ricoh Theta S</h3><p> If that’s a little outside of your price range, and you want something more pocket-sized, consider the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Ricoh Theta S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Retailing at just $350, it’s one of the less expensive camera in our line-up. It has exactly one button for starting and stopping video or image capture, and two bubble eye lenses on opposite sides of the camera. It allows live streaming via mini-HDMI, and has an phone app that can be used to control the camera. The video quality is only average, but this is an excellent choice for the casual 360-degree camera user.</p><p> Wanna know where to Ricoh Theta S, check this video below:</p><h3 id="5-LG360-cam"><a href="#5-LG360-cam" class="headerlink" title="5. LG360 cam"></a>5. LG360 cam</h3><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >LG360 cam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a new offering in the bargain 360-degree cameras. Retailing at only $180, it is comparable in cost to a reasonably good digital camera. This camera is very compact, and connects to your phone with an app, available for both Android and iOS, that allows you to preview&#x2F;review your shots and control the camera. It also allows you to shoot with only one lens at a time, for a 180-degree image.</p><p> All of that said, there are some downsides to this little bargain. The first is that you’ll have to buy a microSD card for storage. The camera requires one, and does not have one included. Another problem is viewing your photos. The camera must transfer files to your phone before they can be viewed, which can take a while, and does not support editing. While you can transfer files to the computer and edit them, this makes the stitching more obvious and you’ll likely have to use some stitching software to clean it up after. Since the LG cam is designed to be a Shoot and Share type camera, it’s better not to try to edit. The image quality is not great, which isn’t unexpected for the price, but it’s a great entry point for new 360-degree camera users, especially ones who just want to experience the technology, without breaking the bank.</p><p> Check a detailed review about LG360 Cam from this video</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> While the Samsung Gear 360 is a nice camera, it, like all of its 360-degree camera brethren, has its shortcomings. For many people, the most problematic is that it’s only compatible with Samsung phones. Fortunately, the above options are largely compatible with any phone, and offer a variety of prices, image quality, and functionality. Since professional grade 360-degree cameras still cost to the tune of $60000, I think I’ll be sticking to one of these inexpensive models, regardless of some of their flaws.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-peak-color-alignment-tool/"><u>2024 Approved  Peak Color Alignment Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-journey-to-mastery-discovering-the-quintessential-5-online-title-makers/"><u>In 2024, Journey to Mastery  Discovering the Quintessential 5 Online Title Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-ion-air-pro-3-breakdown-review-of-the-latest-action-cam/"><u>In 2024, ION Air Pro 3 Breakdown - Review of the Latest Action Cam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-launching-an-online-fundraising-challenge-on-facebook/"><u>[New] Launching an Online Fundraising Challenge on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-inspire-chuckles-designing-memes-on-kapwing/"><u>[New] Inspire Chuckles – Designing Memes on Kapwing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-picture-perfection-ranking-of-photo-grid-tools/"><u>2024 Approved  Picture Perfection  Ranking of Photo Grid Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-no-spend-guide-to-the-best-ae-template-hits/"><u>[New] No-Spend Guide to the Best AE Template Hits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-boosting-engagement-editing-for-perfect-video-titles-and-descriptions/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Boosting Engagement  Editing for Perfect Video Titles & Descriptions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-videos-from-oppo-a78-to-ipad-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Videos from Oppo A78 to iPad | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/discovering-the-finest-no-cost-auditory-effects-vaults/"><u>Discovering the Finest No-Cost Auditory Effects Vaults</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-essential-methods-recording-minecraft-games-on-apple-devices/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Essential Methods  Recording Minecraft Games on Apple Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-time-lapse-magic-the-best-apps-for-capturing-stunning-videos-on-iphone-and-android/"><u>New 2024 Approved Time-Lapse Magic The Best Apps for Capturing Stunning Videos on iPhone and Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-2024s-premier-selection-the-top-8-online-voice-capture-software-for-free-use/"><u>Updated 2024S Premier Selection The Top 8 Online Voice Capture Software for Free Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-key-10-tiktok-filter-techniques-for-memorable-videos/"><u>[Updated] Key 10 TikTok Filter Techniques For Memorable Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/getting-the-pokemon-go-gps-signal-not-found-11-error-in-samsung-galaxy-m34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>Getting the Pokemon Go GPS Signal Not Found 11 Error in Samsung Galaxy M34 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/essential-youtube-equipment-for-starting-your-channel-what-do-you-really-need-for-2024/"><u>Essential YouTube Equipment For Starting Your Channel - What Do You Really Need for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

According to most users, the built-in image viewer is not top of the list. As you keep reading, you will discover why Windows 10 Photos is not a good choice. In addition, you will find recommendations for fast image viewer Windows 10 and why they outrank the proprietary software. Finally, remember that the list contains free and paid programs you can use for your creative work.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">PhotoDirector 365</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">XnView Classic</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">IrfanView Graphic Viewer</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">WidsMob Viewer Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Image Glass</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Best Free Video Editor to Make Slideshow with Photos</a></li><li><a href="#part4">FAQs</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice"><a href="#Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice" class="headerlink" title="Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?"></a>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow"><a href="#1-It-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="4.

Then, change your preferred app by selecting it from the <strong>Photos</strong> menu.</p><p>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</p><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow-1"><a href="#1-It-is-slow-1" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore-1"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience-1"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

The two almost have a close semblance in names and this tend to confuse so many people on the actual types as well as the applications of the cameras. Now that you already have an idea on what a 360-degree camera is from the previous articles, we are going to help you understand how it differs from a 3D camera in terms of design as well as application.</p><h2 id="The-Differences-Between-360-Degree-Cameras-and-3D-Cameras"><a href="#The-Differences-Between-360-Degree-Cameras-and-3D-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="The Differences Between 360-Degree Cameras and 3D Cameras"></a>The Differences Between 360-Degree Cameras and 3D Cameras</h2><p> There are a myriad of glaring differences in the design as we all as the functionality of 360 degrees and 3D cameras. To begin with, 3D cameras are devoted to bringing depth in the images seen by the human eyes, whereas 360 degrees cameras are devoted to creating a sense of immersion for the view when viewing the images. 360 degree cameras make the viewer feel as part of the image and not just something they are seeing from a distant.</p><p> 3D images are unidirectional, in the sense that they can be captured at just a single angle. Though there is the presence of depth, there are no multiple angles hence less perspective in the images. 360 degrees cameras on the other hand capture images from every angle, thus allowing the viewers to explore the image more deeply.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-reality-immersion.jpg"                      alt="Virtual reality image"                ></p><p> &lt;<a href="http://www.businesswire.com>">www.businesswire.com&gt;</a></p><p> Both 3D and 360 degrees cameras can be used for creating virtual reality videos, but with the former, there will be need for additional processing in the form of stitching to bring the images together in the creation of the VR. However, the latter requires no stitching at all in the creation of VR videos or images due to its comprehensive nature.</p><h2 id="About-3D-or-a-Stereo-Camera"><a href="#About-3D-or-a-Stereo-Camera" class="headerlink" title="About 3D or a Stereo Camera"></a>About 3D or a Stereo Camera</h2><h3 id="1-What-is-3D-Camera"><a href="#1-What-is-3D-Camera" class="headerlink" title="1.What is 3D Camera"></a>1.What is 3D Camera</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-3d-camera.jpg"                      alt="3D camera"                ></p><p> wallpaperfolder.com</p><p> Also known as a stereo camera, 3D cameras record images which will appear in three dimensions. The cameras are fitted with two or more lenses, with each lens having a separate film frame or image sensor. This makes it possible for 3D cameras to simulate the human binoculars vision, leading to the rendition of three dimensional images. Such cameras are suitable for taking stereoviews as well as 3D pictures for range imaging or for movies.</p><p> There are other 3D camera configurations where the camera records an image, then the lens shifts slightly before another image is recorded, all happening within a fraction of a second, to result into two different views. Other 3D cameras on the other hand will use a stitching software to put together all the images to create a three dimensional image.</p><h3 id="2-How-Do-3D-Cameras-Work"><a href="#2-How-Do-3D-Cameras-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Do 3D Cameras Work"></a>2. How Do 3D Cameras Work</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3d-camera-principle.png"                      alt="3D camera principal"                ></p><p> &lt;<a href="http://www.reddit.com>">www.reddit.com&gt;</a></p><p> The basic operation of 3D camera is to recreate what the normal human eyes see. It is important to remember that the human eyes are stationed just about two and a half inches apart and this leads to different perspectives of what the eyes see and different interpretation by the brain. With 3D cameras, the brains combine two images so that it can create a sense of depth – usually the third dimension.</p><p> The cameras take two images from slightly different angles and then combine them into one. Most of the 3D cameras are fitted with two lenses to make it possible to capture two images, with the left and the right lenses at the same time. With the use of advanced image processing techniques, the images are then merged together to form a 3D image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3d-image-avatar.JPG"                      alt="3D image"                ></p><p> &lt;<a href="http://www.zavvi.com>">www.zavvi.com&gt;</a></p><p> It is also important to note that most of the 3D cameras take photos or images and save them in the standard MPO format to make it possible for the images to be played back in 3D photo frames or TVs, but to view such images in 3D, a special 3D glass may be needed.</p><h2 id="About-360-Degree-Cameras"><a href="#About-360-Degree-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="About 360-Degree Cameras"></a>About 360-Degree Cameras</h2><h3 id="1-What-is-360-Degree-Camera"><a href="#1-What-is-360-Degree-Camera" class="headerlink" title="1.What is 360-Degree Camera"></a>1.What is 360-Degree Camera</h3><p> A 360-degree camera, also known as omnidirectional camera refers to a camera with a 360-degree field of view in horizontal plane or simply a camera with a visual field of view which can cover an entire sphere. 360-degree cameras are widely used in instances when the photographer needs to cover large visual fields such as when dealing with robotics or panoramic photography.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-360-Degree-Camera-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-360-Degree-Camera-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does 360-Degree Camera Work"></a>2. How Does 360-Degree Camera Work</h3><p> With the normal cameras, the field of view ranges from a few degrees to at most 180 degrees. It implies that the camera capture light falling into its focal point through a hemisphere. A 360-degree camera on the other hand captures light from all directions falling onto its focal point, thus effectively covering a full sphere. One important thing to note about 360-degree cameras is that in practice, they can only cover the full 360 degrees along the equator of the sphere and this is never the case with the top or the bottom of the sphere. Should it manage to capture the top and the bottom as well, then the light rays captured in the creation of the image will not intersect at one focal point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-secrets-of-the-pros-apple-devices-for-premium-interactive-recording/"><u>2024 Approved  Secrets of the Pros  Apple Devices for Premium Interactive Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/pioneering-prospects-cutting-edge-strategies-in-telegram-advertising-for-2024/"><u>Pioneering Prospects  Cutting-Edge Strategies in Telegram Advertising for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-seamless-video-tweaks-integrating-story-remix-into-windows-10-photos/"><u>In 2024, Seamless Video Tweaks  Integrating Story Remix Into Windows 10 Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-interior-illumination-through-natural-sun-exposure/"><u>2024 Approved  Interior Illumination Through Natural Sun Exposure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-intense-action-iphone-tips-for-artistic-motion-blur-photos/"><u>In 2024, Intense Action  IPhone Tips for Artistic Motion-Blur Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-premier-business-cloud-data-solutions/"><u>[Updated] Premier Business Cloud Data Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-best-10-free-converters-for-jpeg-and-gif/"><u>In 2024, Navigating Best 10 Free Converters for JPEG & GIF</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-seamless-integration-of-links-into-tiktok-profiles/"><u>[New] Seamless Integration of Links Into TikTok Profiles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-innovations-in-hand-tracking-and-gesture-detection/"><u>[New] Innovations in Hand Tracking and Gesture Detection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-cutting-edge-tactics-for-polishing-your-social-media-vids-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] Cutting-Edge Tactics for Polishing Your Social Media Vids on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-the-prime-collection-of-pc-screen-capture-tools-win11-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Prime Collection of PC Screen Capture Tools (Win11) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/comprehensive-list-top-screenshot-videography-tools/"><u>Comprehensive List  Top Screenshot Videography Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-livestreaming-facebook-made-simple-for-all-tech-users-for-2024/"><u>[New] Livestreaming Facebook Made Simple for All Tech Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-strategies-for-maximizing-your-facebook-videos/"><u>[Updated] Innovative Strategies for Maximizing Your Facebook Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-fine-tuning-your-films-rhythm-synchronizing-soundtracks-with-video-in-final-cut-pro-x/"><u>New In 2024, Fine-Tuning Your Films Rhythm Synchronizing Soundtracks with Video in Final Cut Pro X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-iphone-8-plus-without-passcode-4-easy-methods-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Unlock iPhone 8 Plus Without Passcode? 4 Easy Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/iphone-is-disabled-here-is-the-way-to-unlock-disabled-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>iPhone Is Disabled?

Remove Red Eyes"></a>4. Remove Red Eyes</h3><p>Red-eyed pictures occur when you capture the image in a night vision or dim light.

It also helps to convey deep meanings with symbolism and double exposures.</p><p>Through this distinct feature of Pixlr editor, apart from combing two photos at once, you can also apply subtle effects to make the photo surreal and creative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/pixlr-photo-editor-tips-5.jpg"                      alt="pixlr double exposure feature"                ></p><h3 id="6-Splash-the-Colors"><a href="#6-Splash-the-Colors" class="headerlink" title="6.

As I understand things, this is because Dolby HDR is not supported.</em></p><p><em>Is there a workaround I can use to get the color back in my videos?</em></p><p><em>Also, any ideas when Adobe will eventually provide support for Dolby HDR?” – A user asked from Adobe Support Community</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-1.jpg"                      alt="solutions for iphone hdr"                ></p><p>While the Adobe Premiere Pro software is useful tool for video editing, there are situations when the video quality looks overexposed. The quality appears blown out during the import process. This happens due to incompatibility issues with the Smart HDR feature in iPhone 12 series devices, which cannot work on older models.</p><p>There are particular ways in which it is possible to rectify the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video</strong> quality issue. In this article, we discuss that further.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13"></a>Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13</h2><p>Before we start discussing how to fix the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> problem at hand, one should understand what Dolby Vision HDR means in the first place. To note, it is a proprietary type of HDR format, with more data than SDR videos. This is because the camera quality with HDR effect can capture video recordings with extra data regarding the scenes, like shadows, highlights, and color range.</p><p>Moreover, the Dolby Vision type of <strong>HDR video iPhone 12</strong> feature works with dynamic metadata, which is useful for tone-mapping images in frame-to-frame or scene-by-scene format. The iPhone 12 devices allow the user to shoot high-quality Dolby Vision HDR videos in 4K, at 30-60 FPS. That is possible with the support of extra RAM in these device models and the presence of the A14 Bionic system-on-chip. Not to mention, iPhone 12 models come with a 10-bit OLED display.</p><p>Such factors make the demand for Dolby Vision <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> settings reasonable. However, the Dolby Vision quality only works on the most compatible devices with relevant display types. At this point, iPhone 12 is the only phone with this feature in the camera, which limits the ability to share 10-bit HDR videos to other devices or platforms, like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Having HDR-based video playing in the SDR display type would automatically make the colors look weird and washed out. If the software came with an SDR squash functionality for importing&#x2F;exporting Dolby Vision HDR videos in SDR format, that would benefit users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed"><a href="#Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?"></a>Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?</h2><p>It is inaccurate to assume that the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> issues like overexposure or washed-out appearance occur due to Adobe Premiere not supporting Dolby HDR. On the other hand, the more reasonable reason is that most of the screens and system versions do not work with this functionality.</p><p>So, even if you use the Premiere Pro software and import exact images with accurate color composition and resolution, the image quality might look bad on most devices. If a monitor supports the HDR quality and you choose the relevant color space, overexposure issues will be limited.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to click the video with the <strong>HDR video camera</strong> and display it on the right platform&#x2F;screen. In Premiere Pro, the Override into Rec.709 solution is available and can work to rectify this issue for some users.</p><p>With the right features like Color Workspace, Lumetri pre-sets, and other features, you can add them in a drag-and-drop manner to work on the project pane for more customizations.</p><p>The Premiere Pro 2022 version can work with the video clips as HDR after changing specific CM settings. The right monitoring setup must be prepared while working on this editing environment.</p><p>Also, it is important to consider the nits’ levels on screens to understand if a device can even display the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video.</strong> These devices support a 10-bit OLED display type that can reach a peak brightness of 1200 nits. So, it is suitable to showcase the footage without much error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro</h2><p>The following are some of the feasible solutions we’ve gathered, you can take to handle the overexposure quality of HDR videos while using Premiere Pro.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR"><a href="#Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR"></a>Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR</h3><p>One of the easiest methods to avoid issues with <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> is to switch off the HDR setting directly.

Reels also help you in gaining organic followers for your page. It is an innovative idea if you wish to create your own Instagram page that displays the unboxing of prevalent products.</p><h3 id="Requirements-of-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Requirements-of-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Requirements of Instagram Reels"></a>Requirements of Instagram Reels</h3><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Size in Pixels</strong></th><th>1080 x 1920</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Size Ratio</strong></td><td>9:16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Length</strong></td><td>Maximum 90 seconds</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Format</strong></td><td>MP4, MOV</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Thumbnail Size in Pixels</strong></td><td>1080 x 1080</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-2-8-Tips-on-How-to-Create-Attractive-Instagram-Unboxing-Reels"><a href="#Part-2-8-Tips-on-How-to-Create-Attractive-Instagram-Unboxing-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 8 Tips on How to Create Attractive Instagram Unboxing Reels"></a>Part 2: 8 Tips on How to Create Attractive Instagram Unboxing Reels</h2><p>Many things can help you in creating reels that attract users and help you in increasing followers. Unboxing reels on Instagram will never be out of trend; thus, you need to work on your unboxing skills. It is essential for you to create attractive reels because these reels can drive 67% more engagement to your page. The tips mentioned below can help you proficiently in your <strong>unboxing Instagram</strong> success:</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Good-Camera-Equipment-and-Recording-Environment"><a href="#Tip-1-Good-Camera-Equipment-and-Recording-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Good Camera Equipment and Recording Environment"></a>Tip 1: Good Camera Equipment and Recording Environment</h3><p>You should have a good camera for shooting videos because it is a basic part of reels. If you shoot an <strong>unboxing video on Instagram</strong> without a good camera, it will bore the users. A high-quality camera will drive a high number of followers in a minimum time. A camera equipment like a tripod stand is a must for unboxing reels. With it, you can record reels without setting up the camera again and again.</p><p>As for the environment, make sure it’s tidy. People will not only focus on unboxing, but this factor is also a fundamental part of good Instagram reels. Simply put, always work with high-quality cameras and equipment in a clean and aesthetically pleasing space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-reels-on-instagram-3.jpg"                      alt="use good recording equipment"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-2-Keep-the-Focus-on-the-Product-Throughout-the-Video"><a href="#Tip-2-Keep-the-Focus-on-the-Product-Throughout-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Keep the Focus on the Product Throughout the Video"></a>Tip 2: Keep the Focus on the Product Throughout the Video</h3><p>Make sure to set the focus of your camera before recording reels. <strong>Unboxing the Instagram</strong> page should always focus on showing the product in higher quality. Imagine you shoot a video of a makeup box from Sephora, and if the focus is not on the box but on the table, do you think viewers will like it? They will ultimately bounce back, impacting your page’s followers and reels.</p><p>Thus, always give first priority to the product. It will be a positive thing for your unboxing influencer career. Keep your camera neat and clean, and check its focus from time to time while shooting the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-reels-on-instagram-4.jpg"                      alt="have a proper angle of the product"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Keep-the-Video-Short"><a href="#Tip-3-Keep-the-Video-Short" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Keep the Video Short"></a>Tip 3: Keep the Video Short</h3><p>This is very important that you do not exceed the time of Instagram reels. The ideal time limit for <strong>unboxing videos on Instagram</strong> is 15 to 60 seconds. Thus, make sure you never lengthen the video until necessary. It will help you give high-quality short and precise unboxing reels. Users can get what they are looking for in a limited time.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Resize-your-Unboxing-Reels-to-Fit-Instagram"><a href="#Tip-4-Resize-your-Unboxing-Reels-to-Fit-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Resize your Unboxing Reels to Fit Instagram"></a>Tip 4: Resize your Unboxing Reels to Fit Instagram</h3><p>The ideal size of Instagram’s <strong>unboxing reels</strong> is 1080x1920p. Confirm this resolution before posting a video so you will not face any problems in the future. Above all, there are both landscape and portrait reels, but the reliable ones are portrait. Posting the unboxing video in portrait mode will drive more followers to your page.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Add-Captions-for-Your-Unboxing-Reels"><a href="#Tip-5-Add-Captions-for-Your-Unboxing-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Add Captions for Your Unboxing Reels"></a>Tip 5: Add Captions for Your Unboxing Reels</h3><p>Unboxing captions for Instagram can be a very helpful thing for many users. If a user is deaf, he will definitely need captions because of hearing impairment. Other than this, many people love to watch videos without voices, so it can be a complementary thing for you. When you add captions to an Instagram reel, it will assist you in standing apart from your competitors.</p><p>People can get what you are saying more clearly. Moreover, not everyone can understand English, so captions can help them out in this scenario.

A soothing soundtrack can improve engagement and also attract music lovers. Alongside the unboxing captions, music is also a must-have for Instagram reels. Thus, select a piece of music that is like a melody to the ears.</p><p>Don’t try to add beatbox sounds in the videos because it will not suit them. However, you have to select a sound that matches the theme of your product. For example, selecting Disney music for toy unboxing Instagram is good. You can create an immersive and memorable user experience with an appealing soundtrack.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Learn-More-From-Others"><a href="#Tip-7-Learn-More-From-Others" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Learn More From Others"></a>Tip 7: Learn More From Others</h3><p>There are uncountable <strong>unboxing reels</strong> on Instagram.

The original version of the Karma drone was recalled just 16 days after its initial launch when many drones were losing connection and battery power at certain altitudes. GoPro discovered a fault with the battery popping out of place causing immediate power loss and returns the drone to the drawing board to produce improved versions of the device for release.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-karma.jpg"                      alt="gopro karma"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5V4HKQ/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N5V4HKQ&linkId=62a69de1ac6675d917158fa1421eceee" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The rerelease of the Karma drone has fixed the battery removal issue by adding in auxiliary latches which secure the battery in the future. This was the only major change that GoPro made originally but the newest version includes a number of additional features as well.</p><p> Apart from the battery latch, GoPro introduced auxiliary features such as a tilted horizon line for improved imaging as well as quieter propellers. The rerelease of the Karma drone is a much more polished product that is more suitable for reviewing as well as improved for general use. But does the Karma drone matchup with major contenders in the marketplace such as the Parrot or the DJI phantom line?</p><h2 id="Pros-and-cons-of-GoPro-Karma"><a href="#Pros-and-cons-of-GoPro-Karma" class="headerlink" title="Pros and cons of GoPro Karma"></a>Pros and cons of GoPro Karma</h2><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Good image quality thanks to GoPro Hero5 4k action camera: With a drone that was designed around an already excellent camera, this is definitely a product that is created with the imaging in mind first.</li><li>Stabilization: The stabilization package has definitely improved not only the silent running of the drone but the way that it controls in the air.</li><li>Tight controls: The controls on this device are extremely tight and this means it’s quite easy to get around in small places or even keep full control on the drone as it’s flying in indoor spaces.</li><li>Portable: The GoPro Karma also has a fold up design which keeps it extremely portable and perfect for fitting in any type of backpack or for taking with you for travel. Just as you would pack along any type of GoPro camera, this is a drone that fits well into luggage or for any type of vacation.<br> <strong>Cons:</strong></li><li>Lacks if collision detection: The GoPro Karma did not come with any type of collision detection, autonomous flight control, auto landing function or helpful features that can make flying easier.</li><li>Short battery life: The other negative aspect of the drone is that even with the improvements to secure the battery the drone comes with a relatively short battery life. If you are looking to get a lot of images from this drone it features just a very short flight time. With zero collision detection or extra features with the computer there are more intelligent drones available on the market that can also boast a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >longer battery life <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><strong>Verdict</strong></li></ul><p> The overall verdict is that this is a fantastic drone for capturing stunning images but it doesn’t have the easy flying mode or the battery life to compete with some of the best drones available at the same price point. Although you might have to sacrifice a bit in image quality when compared to a GoPro camera with some competitors, it’s often worth it for value knowing that you can capture the shot and maintain control over your drone.</p><h2 id="Detailed-review-for-GoPro-Karma"><a href="#Detailed-review-for-GoPro-Karma" class="headerlink" title="Detailed review for GoPro Karma"></a>Detailed review for GoPro Karma</h2><h4 id="1-Price"><a href="#1-Price" class="headerlink" title="1.  Price"></a>1.  Price</h4><p> Karma without a GoPro Camera: $799</p><p> Karma with a GoPro Hero5 Session Camera: $999</p><p> Karma with a GoPro Hero5 Balck Camera: $1099</p><h4 id="2-Design"><a href="#2-Design" class="headerlink" title="2.  Design"></a>2.  Design</h4><p> The GoPro Karma drone design is really built to house the camera rather than produce a drone that is simple and intuitive to fly. Although the flight performance is fairly good for its automatic shooting modes, it can be pretty tough to pilot the drone without a bit of practise. The design is quite resilient and lightened which keeps this drone extremely portable.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-and-flight-time"><a href="#3-Battery-and-flight-time" class="headerlink" title="3.  Battery and flight time"></a>3.  Battery and flight time</h4><p> The battery life of the GoPro Karma is one of the weakest points of this drone there are many other drones in a similar price point including the DJI mavic that can stay in the sky for over 25 min. with a wealth of other intelligent controls and a similar shooting quality. With a flight time estimated at 20 min. from the 5100 mAH battery, most test flights last around 17 minutes. The drone takes at least an hour to recharge and the controller and grip also need to be regularly charged in order to maintain connection with the device.</p><h4 id="4-Flight-performance"><a href="#4-Flight-performance" class="headerlink" title="4.  Flight performance"></a>4.  Flight performance</h4><p> The flight performance of this drone is basically added best when the drone is placed in one of 4 of the automatic shooting modes. The GoPro doesn’t have that many when compared to some of the competition and they are really just the option to shoot ahead, shoot on fixed point with the drone moving, shooting on a point of reveal as well as shooting in an orbit around a subject.</p><p><strong>Four modes</strong></p><p> Orbit: In this mode, the drone will orbit around a fixed subject.</p><p> Dronie: In this mode, you can take a selfie while the drone zooms out and away from you.</p><p> Reveal: In this mode, Karma will fly towards a subject and slowly rotate the camera gimbal up to the horizon.</p><p> Cable Cam: In this mode, you can set two points in the sky and then make the drone fly back and forth between those points over and over again.</p><h4 id="5-Controller"><a href="#5-Controller" class="headerlink" title="5.  Controller"></a>5.  Controller</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-karma-controller.jpg"                      alt="gopro karma controller"                ></p><p> One thing that the GoPro Karma did especially well was creating a beautiful controller. The RC controller is relatively small but it feels exactly like playing a videogame with plenty of functions and no need to have a compatible device to use the drone. The other extremely strong point is the camera. Nobody can build a great outdoor camera that is it as resilient as a GoPro with the Hero 5 Black version of this drone capable of shooting in 4K with an astounding video quality, you can catch some amazing video as well as incredible still images on this drone.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Overall, the GoPro Karma is a fairly strong showing for a drone. Although it can be expensive when compared to the specifications on some of the other drones, if you do have some experience flying drones and you are looking for a great image quality, this could be the choice for you especially if you are looking for a portable drone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-lightrooms-ultimate-guide-to-premium-luts/"><u>[New] LightRoom's Ultimate Guide to Premium LUTs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-mending-a-singular-audio-unit/"><u>[Updated] Mending a Singular Audio Unit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-revolution-at-your-desk-windows-10-updates-reviewed/"><u>In 2024, Revolution at Your Desk  Windows 10 Updates Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-jumpstart-to-joyous-animation-a-guide-in-movie-maker-world/"><u>[New] Jumpstart to Joyous Animation  A Guide in Movie Maker World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/integrating-cg-centrals-luts-into-vfx-production-flows-for-2024/"><u>Integrating CG Central's Luts Into VFX Production Flows for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastery-in-making-the-perfect-match-of-drones-and-propellers/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastery in Making the Perfect Match of Drones and Propellers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-maximize-your-digital-life-30-budget-friendly-cloud-solutions-1tbplus/"><u>In 2024, Maximize Your Digital Life  30 Budget-Friendly Cloud Solutions (1TB+)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-crafting-effective-affordable-youtube-intros-with-templates/"><u>[New] In 2024, Crafting Effective, Affordable YouTube Intros with Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/what-is-ai-voice-over-in-2024/"><u>What Is AI Voice Over, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/in-2024-video-editing-face-off-premiere-pro-vs-after-effects-whats-the-best-choice/"><u>In 2024, Video Editing Face-Off Premiere Pro vs After Effects - Whats the Best Choice?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-pocket-guide-retaining-twitter-media-on-your-cellphone-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Pocket Guide  Retaining Twitter Media on Your Cellphone for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-superior-compre-points-to-free-high-quality-icons/"><u>In 2024, Superior, Compre Points to Free High-Quality Icons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-leading-speech-gatherers-in-educational-environments/"><u>[New] Leading Speech Gatherers in Educational Environments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-fast-techniques-to-restructure-your-youtube-sequence/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Fast Techniques to Restructure Your YouTube Sequence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-premium-facelift-tech-top-facial-editing-apps/"><u>In 2024, Premium Facelift Tech  Top Facial Editing Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-premier-audio-harvesting-technique-for-videos-mastering-sound-retrieval/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Premier Audio Harvesting Technique for Videos Mastering Sound Retrieval</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Though, if a picture has been taken a long time back, then it might lose its quality. A lot of people end up losing their precious photos due to all kinds of incidents.</p><p>Therefore, it is highly recommended to digitize photos to make them lasting. In this way, you can make your photos last forever and keep them handy. In this post, I’m going to discuss some smart ways to <strong>digitize photos</strong> without any hassle. In another case, you may want to know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to restore old photos in old devices. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/digitize-old-photos.jpg"                      alt="Digitize Old Photos"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Digitize Your Memorable Old Photos</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Convert Old Photos into a Video with Ease?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: More Editing Tips for Creating Memorable Videos</a></li></ul><h2 id="4-Smart-Ways-to-Digitize-Your-Memorable-Old-Photos"><a href="#4-Smart-Ways-to-Digitize-Your-Memorable-Old-Photos" class="headerlink" title="4 Smart Ways to Digitize Your Memorable Old Photos"></a>4 Smart Ways to Digitize Your Memorable Old Photos</h2><p>With time, the way we capture moments has also been changed. These days, Polaroid cameras have been replaced by various smartphones and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K DSLR cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Nevertheless, you can digitize your photos in either of the following ways so that you can convert them into softcopy and easily move them around.</p><h4 id="1-Use-your-Smartphones-or-Digital-Cameras"><a href="#1-Use-your-Smartphones-or-Digital-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="1. Use your Smartphones or Digital Cameras"></a>1. Use your Smartphones or Digital Cameras</h4><p>This is something that you might have thought of doing before as well. We all use smartphones to take pictures, but have you ever thought of using the device’s camera to scan your old photographs. The same can be done by using any digital camera too.</p><p>Just make sure that you have proper lighting and all the pictures are organized. Now, just use your smartphone camera to take their pictures. Later, you can connect your phone (or its SD card) to your computer and transfer these scanned copies to any secure location. If you want, you can also upload your photos to the cloud to keep them safe.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Scanner"><a href="#2-Use-a-Scanner" class="headerlink" title="2. Use a Scanner"></a>2. Use a Scanner</h4><p>If you have access to a scanner, then it would make it pretty easy for you to digitize photos. Most of the digital scanners won’t even cost that much. Therefore, if you have a lot of pictures to scan, then you can just buy a scanner. You can also find a scanner available at a nearby digital store that you can use on a per-copy basis.</p><p>Once you have scanned your photos, you can transfer them to a pen drive or move them to any other device of your choice.</p><h4 id="3-Use-a-Photo-Scanner-App"><a href="#3-Use-a-Photo-Scanner-App" class="headerlink" title="3. Use a Photo Scanner App"></a>3. Use a Photo Scanner App</h4><p>There are also tons of readily available apps that you can use on your Android or iOS devices to digitize photos. You can just go to the App Store or Play Store on your device to browse the available scanner apps (most of them are free).</p><p>Some popular photo scanners that you can consider using are Scanner Pro, PhotoScan, ShoeBox, or PicScanner. Out of them, PhotoScan by Google is one of the most reliable options that I would recommend. It will help you easily scan your photos, edit them accordingly, and minimize their glare. You can also directly load your scanned pictures to your Google Photos account from here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photo-scanner-app.jpg"                      alt="Photo Scanner App"                ></p><h4 id="4-Get-in-Touch-with-a-Professional"><a href="#4-Get-in-Touch-with-a-Professional" class="headerlink" title="4.

Apart from that, a lot of people would also like to make a video collage of their favorite pictures as well.

What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly.

In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

Some of these platforms are:</p><h3 id="1-Meta"><a href="#1-Meta" class="headerlink" title="1. Meta"></a>1. Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><h3 id="2-Microsoft"><a href="#2-Microsoft" class="headerlink" title="2. Microsoft"></a>2. Microsoft</h3><p>It is another tech giant that has advanced considerably in this direction when it revealed its very own hologram technology back in 2019. Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe. The company would also start working on the development of 3D hyper-real spaces for the world of retail and general workplaces.</p><h3 id="3-Epic-Games"><a href="#3-Epic-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Epic Games"></a>3. Epic Games</h3><p>Epic Games is a video game company that has made headlines by virtue of its extraordinary contributions in this regard. “It’s no secret that Epic is invested in building the metaverse”, said Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games. Epic Games has made it further immersive by holding music concerts by artists like Arianna Grande, Travis Scott, unveiling movie trailers and music debuts in the metaverse. A splendid remaking of Martin Luther King Jr’s famed “I Have a Dream” speech earned it further credentials. Epic Games is reportedly emphasizing its MetaHuman Creator, a technology that helps users customize better their digital avatars.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know"></a>Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</h2><p>It is entering the metaverse that necessitates that one first has one’s props ready. Below are discussed metaverse devices that are crucial for such transportation.</p><h3 id="1-Computer-PC"><a href="#1-Computer-PC" class="headerlink" title="1. Computer (PC)"></a>1. Computer (PC)</h3><p>Laying your hands on a perfectly functioning computer device is one of the first necessities. Intel grabbed worldwide attention a few days ago when it said that for metaverse to work properly, one will need devices with 1000x more computing power than what the technology offers today. But since metaverse is still in its embryo, the configuration we have already functioned just fine.</p><h3 id="2-Smartphone"><a href="#2-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="2. Smartphone"></a>2. Smartphone</h3><p>Smartphones are the next important metaverse device with chipmakers like Qualcomm, Samsung already sharing their dedication to the mobile metaverse segment. Smartphones with the hardware they already come with are useful though for enjoying some of the games and platforms that use augmented reality.</p><h3 id="3-5G-Mobile-Networks"><a href="#3-5G-Mobile-Networks" class="headerlink" title="3.5G Mobile Networks"></a>3.5G Mobile Networks</h3><p>For metaverse to really get under one’s skin, one needs a powerful and lightning-fast network that 5G technology promises. Extensive penetration of 5G mobile networks is therefore extremely important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-5g-network.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device 5G Network"                ></p><p>Source: firstpoint-mg.com</p><h3 id="4-AR-Glasses"><a href="#4-AR-Glasses" class="headerlink" title="4.

These are smart wearables and help in embodied experiences.</p><h3 id="5-VR-Headset"><a href="#5-VR-Headset" class="headerlink" title="5. VR Headset"></a>5. VR Headset</h3><p>Virtual Reality (VR) headsets make use of technologies such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, etc along with a stereoscopic head-mounted display that provides separate images for each eye. Among metaverse devices, these are steadily gaining popularity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-glasses-hololens.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse VR Headset"                ></p><p>Source: theverge.com</p><h3 id="6-VR-Gloves"><a href="#6-VR-Gloves" class="headerlink" title="6.

Sounds insane but companies like HaptX have already offered their line-ups of such hyper-real interfaces.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-vr-gloves.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device VR Gloves"                ></p><p>Source: wired.com</p><h3 id="7-Wrist-Based-Bands"><a href="#7-Wrist-Based-Bands" class="headerlink" title="7.

As long as the ethical underpinnings of such a development get predominant over the technology part, we must welcome such efforts. As some reports on the prevailing sexist atmospheres in some metaverse spaces have underlined, the realm needs regulations. The impact on the environment, data privacy are some other issues that we must come to terms with. Beyond these, the possibilities that metaverse technology has already pointed at herald a future that is every bit worth experiencing.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The concept of metaverse needs not be demonized at this early stage. In fact, the very fact that the idea is still inchoate makes us agents of deciding whether we want to create a bubble universe that keeps out the digital proletariat or a universe that can get past the constraints of time and space to give a new lease of human creativity. But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay. And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey. With a flurry of brands offering good products, the only thing one needs to get right is the basics of such devices.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Buzzwords are nothing new.

As long as the ethical underpinnings of such a development get predominant over the technology part, we must welcome such efforts. As some reports on the prevailing sexist atmospheres in some metaverse spaces have underlined, the realm needs regulations. The impact on the environment, data privacy are some other issues that we must come to terms with. Beyond these, the possibilities that metaverse technology has already pointed at herald a future that is every bit worth experiencing.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The concept of metaverse needs not be demonized at this early stage. In fact, the very fact that the idea is still inchoate makes us agents of deciding whether we want to create a bubble universe that keeps out the digital proletariat or a universe that can get past the constraints of time and space to give a new lease of human creativity. But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay. And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey. With a flurry of brands offering good products, the only thing one needs to get right is the basics of such devices.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-selecting-superior-hdr-cameras-a-buyers-guide/"><u>In 2024, Selecting Superior HDR Cameras  A Buyer's Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-premier-playwrighting-for-public-broadcast/"><u>In 2024, Premier Playwrighting for Public Broadcast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/launching-a-vlog-top-kit-and-applications-for-2024/"><u>Launching a Vlog  Top Kit & Applications for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-sharpen-your-skills-with-these-essential-pixlr-tips/"><u>In 2024, Sharpen Your Skills with These Essential Pixlr Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-optimal-mic-selection-for-professional-4k-filmmaking/"><u>2024 Approved  Optimal Mic Selection for Professional 4K Filmmaking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/low-cost-options-for-acquiring-gopro-cameras-for-2024/"><u>Low-Cost Options for Acquiring GoPro Cameras for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-premier-action-cam-editors-and-software/"><u>In 2024, Premier Action Cam Editors and Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/does-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-have-find-my-friends-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G Have Find My Friends? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-from-live-to-recorded-simplifying-facebook-broadcasting/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  From Live to Recorded  Simplifying Facebook Broadcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-rated-free-wmv-video-editing-tools-expert-recommendations/"><u>2024 Approved Top-Rated Free WMV Video Editing Tools Expert Recommendations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/advanced-techniques-developing-elapsed-time-features-in-obs-software-for-2024/"><u>Advanced Techniques  Developing Elapsed Time Features in OBS Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-atandt-apple-iphone-12-pro-with-3-methods-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock AT&T Apple iPhone 12 Pro with 3 Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pinnacle-studio-for-mac-explore-these-excellent-alternative-options/"><u>2024 Approved Pinnacle Studio for Mac Explore These Excellent Alternative Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/updated-10-of-the-best-disney-animated-shows-sorted-by-popularity-ascending/"><u>Updated 10 of the Best Disney Animated Shows (Sorted by Popularity Ascending)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/kitchen-kings-and-queens-on-tiktok-viral-recipes-to-try/"><u>Kitchen Kings and Queens on TikTok  Viral Recipes to Try</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
