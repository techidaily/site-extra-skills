## How to Animate the Zoom effect in Videoleap

In other words, using the animated zoom effect in Videoleap, you will be able to zoom into your footage. And a major way to apply this effect is by considering the keyframes of the raw footage.

And if you also want to animate the zoom effect in Videoleap, here is how you can do it:

* Open the Videoleap application and click on the "+" icon to import files to the application interface. Then you will be available with the video file on a timeline that you want to edit.
* Now, drag the play head on the timeline where you want to start the zoom effect to take place.
